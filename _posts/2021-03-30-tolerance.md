  I just refactored a piece of code. I deleted 6 source code files, and rebuilt the functionality with a bunch of dirty OOP classes shoved in a single file üò±
</p>

I used OOP for simplification, and in the process I got rid of type parameters, type classes, and implicit parameters. Plain-old OOP design saved the day, i.e. shove those side effects behind an interface, and pass those objects around, blissfully unaware as to what they do (launching rockets A-OK). *It was glorious!* I can't remember the last time it felt this good.

Then it dawned on me that I wrote that code to begin with. This piece already underwent a major refactoring, having introduced extra complexity, without catching the subtleties, or smelling the stench of my own doing. What's going on?

I started blaming the COVID-19 pandemic, it's been a year since I've been lethargic (aka mild to moderate depression), missing the creative energy that I remember since before the world went mad. But then I started giving myself some credit, because the truth is ... as I grow old, I tolerate people more, while tolerating BS in programming less.

This is another way of saying that you should never forget *YAGNI*[^1], *KISS*[^2], the *Principle of Least Surprise*[^3], or whatever kids call it these days. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should, with great power comes great responsibility, learn from my mistakes, etc, etc. Also, sometimes *DRY*[^4] is a bad philosophy, copy/paste that shit.

Now get off my lawn.

[^1]: [You Ain't Gonna Need It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) is what agile developers crave for
[^2]: [Keep It Simple Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) was a hip phrase back in my Ruby days, but searching "KISS Ruby" on Google yielded some strange results
[^3]: OOP and FP developers actually understand different things by the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[^4]: [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is not the mantra of Go developers
