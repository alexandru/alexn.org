  The best best practices are those enforced by the build tools, as part of the build process. Don't annoy your colleagues in code reviews, let the build tools do that for you.

The Scala compiler has multiple linting options available and emits certain warnings out of the box that would be more useful as errors. Let's see how we can rely on the Scala compiler to strengthen our code and piss off your colleagues with clean code requirements.

## Best Practice: Stop Ignoring Warnings!

Some of it might be noise, however in that noise some real gems might be missed, warnings that signal bugs. For example the compiler can do exhaustiveness checks when pattern matching:

```scala
def size(list: List[_]): Int =
  list match {
    case _ :: rest => 1 + size(rest)
  }
// On line 2: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
//        It would fail on the following input: Nil  
```

Here's what happens next:

```scala
size(List(1,2,3))
// scala.MatchError: List() (of class scala.collection.immutable.Nil$)
```

It shouldn't be just a warning. Even if you're diligent, this warning can get lost in a sea of other warnings, like it often does. And here we were lucky, because the runtime exception was triggered on the happy path, but our luck would eventually run out and end up with such exceptions in production.

## 1. Activate -Xfatal-warnings

To turn all compiler warnings into errors, you can activate `-Xfatal-warnings`. In [build.sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Basic-Def.html):

```scala
scalacOptions ++= Seq(
  "-Xfatal-warnings",
  //...
)
```

Now if we try out the code above, we get an error like this:

```
[error] .../Example.scala:10:5: match may not be exhaustive.
[error] It would fail on the following input: Nil
[error]     list match {
[error]     ^
[error] one error found
```

Thus we can no longer ignore it.

## 2. Activate All Linting Options

There are many useful compiler options that you could activate. You can find a (possibly non-complete) list on [docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/compiler-options/index.html). 

<p class="info-bubble">
  <strong>WARNING:</strong> the compiler evolves and it's good to keep this list up to date (see next tip)!
</p>

For Scala 2.13 at the time of writing, here's my list of `scalac` options:

```scala
scalacOptions := Seq(
  // Feature options
  "-encoding", "utf-8",
  "-explaintypes",
  "-feature",
  "-language:existentials",
  "-language:experimental.macros",
  "-language:higherKinds",
  "-language:implicitConversions",
  "-Ymacro-annotations",

  // Warnings as errors!
  "-Xfatal-warnings",

  // Linting options
  "-unchecked",
  "-Xcheckinit",
  "-Xlint:adapted-args",
  "-Xlint:constant",
  "-Xlint:delayedinit-select",
  "-Xlint:deprecation",
  "-Xlint:doc-detached",
  "-Xlint:inaccessible",
  "-Xlint:infer-any",
  "-Xlint:missing-interpolator",
  "-Xlint:nullary-override",
  "-Xlint:nullary-unit",
  "-Xlint:option-implicit",
  "-Xlint:package-object-classes",
  "-Xlint:poly-implicit-overload",
  "-Xlint:private-shadow",
  "-Xlint:stars-align",
  "-Xlint:type-parameter-shadow",
  "-Wdead-code",
  "-Wextra-implicit",
  "-Wnumeric-widen",
  "-Wunused:implicits",
  "-Wunused:imports",
  "-Wunused:locals",
  "-Wunused:params",
  "-Wunused:patvars",
  "-Wunused:privates",
  "-Wvalue-discard",
)
```

There are many useful options in there, from disallowing "adapted args", detecting inaccessible code, inferred `Any`, shadowing of values, to unused imports and params and others.

### 2.1. Use the sbt-tpolecat plugin

Keeping that list of compiler options up to date is exhausting, new useful options get added all the time, others are deprecated and especially for libraries you have to deal with multiple Scala versions in the same project.

A better option is to include [sbt-tpolecat](https://github.com/DavidGregory084/sbt-tpolecat) in your project.

## 3. Exclude annoying linting warnings, project wide

Some linting options can trigger false positives that are too annoying. It's fine to remove them from your project, or from certain configurations (e.g. `Test`, `Console`).

For example I do not like the `-Wunused:privates` option, because it triggers an annoying false positive when defining (unused) default values in `case class` definitions.

If using `sbt-tpolecat`, as mentioned above, you can include something like this in your build definition:

```scala
scalacOptions in Compile ~= { options: Seq[String] =>
  options.filterNot(
    Set(
      "-Wunused:privates"
    )
  )
}
```

## 4. Silence warnings

Sometimes you want to ignore a certain warning:

- maybe it's a false positive
- maybe you want something "unused", as a placeholder, etc

### 4.1. Silencer plugin (Scala < 2.13)

You can use the [ghik/silencer](https://github.com/ghik/silencer) compiler plugin.

For our sample above, if we want to silence that exhaustiveness check:

```scala
import com.github.ghik.silencer.silent

@silent("not.*?exhaustive")
def size(list: List[_]): Int =
  list match {
    case _ :: rest => 1 + size(rest)
  }
```

The annotation can be given a regular expression that should match the warning being silenced.

We can also silence the source files on a path using a compiler option in `build.sbt`:

```scala
scalacOptions += "-P:silencer:pathFilters=.*[/]src_managed[/].*"
```

### 4.2. Using @nowarn in Scala 2.13.2

Scala 2.13 has added the [@nowarn annotation for local suppression](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8373).

`@nowarn` can be more fine grained. We could do just like the above and silence with a pattern matcher:

```scala
import scala.annotation.nowarn

@nowarn("msg=not.*?exhaustive")
def size(list: List[_]): Int =
  list match {
    case _ :: rest => 1 + size(rest)
  }
```

But we can do better, because the actual error messages are brittle. We can silence based on the "category" of the warning. To find the category of a warning, we can (temporarily) enable extra verbosity in these messages via this compiler option in `build.sbt`:

```scala
scalacOptions += "-Wconf:any:warning-verbose"
```

That error will then look like this:

```
[error] ... [other-match-analysis @ size] match may not be exhaustive.
```

The category is "`other-match-analysis`", so we can silence it like this:

```scala
@nowarn("cat=other-match-analysis")
def size(list: List[_]): Int =
  list match {
    case _ :: rest => 1 + size(rest)
  }
```

<p class="info-bubble" markdown="1">
  **NOTE:** for **forward compatibility** in older Scala versions, with the [Silencer plugin](#41-silencer-plugin-scala--213), coupled with [scala-library-compat](https://github.com/scala/scala-library-compat), you can use the new `@nowarn` annotation with older Scala versions, however only the `@nowarn("msg=<pattern>")` filtering is supported.
</p>

## 5. Other linters

You shouldn't stop at Scala's linting options. There are other sbt plugins available that can enforce certain best practices. Off the top of my head:

- [Scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix) (this one can even rewrite the code for you ðŸ˜‰)
- [Wartremover](https://github.com/wartremover/wartremover)
- [Scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat)
- [Scalastyle](https://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle)

With these you could ban `null` or `Any` from your project, among other very useful options.

Any useful plugins that I'm missing?

## Final words

Scala is a static language, but sometimes it isn't static or opinionated enough. The more you can prove about your code at compile time, the less defects you can have at runtime.

Now go forth and annoy your colleagues with actually useful compiler errors!
