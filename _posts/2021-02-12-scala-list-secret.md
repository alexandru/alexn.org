OOP couples the "data" with the methods operating on it, and that's considered bad in FP circles, because supposedly data outlives the functions operating on it. Also in static FP circles, dumb data structures are reusable, so it's a good idea to make them generic, and add restrictions on the functions themselves.

Few data structures could be simpler than an immutable `List` definition, right? At least as far as recursive data structures go üôÇ For the standard `List` you'd expect the following:

```scala
sealed abstract class List[+A]

final case class :: [+A](head: A, tail: List[A])
  extends List[A]

case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
```

Oh boy, I've got news for you ‚Äî this is the actual definition from Scala's standard library:

```scala
sealed abstract class List[+A]

final case class :: [+A](
  head: A, 
  private[scala] var next: List[A @uncheckedVariance]) // üò±
  extends List[A]

case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
```

Yikes, that private `next` value is a `var`. They added it as a `var` such that [ListBuffer](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/mutable/ListBuffer.html) can build a list more efficiently, because an immutable `List` is in essence a [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), so to build one, you'd need to do an O(n) reversal at the end.

With the pure definition, we'd build `List` values like this:

```scala
def map[A, B](self: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = {
  var buffer = List.empty[B]
  for (elem <- self) { buffer = f(elem) :: buffer  }
  // Extra O(n) tax if that list would be pure, no way around it
  buffer.reverse
}
```

But with `ListBuffer`, due to making use of that `var`:

```scala
def map[A, B](self: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = {
  val buffer = ListBuffer.empty[B]
  for (elem <- self) { buffer += f(elem)  }
  // O(1), no inefficiency
  buffer.toList
}
```

Contrary to popular opinion, this means `List` does not benefit from `final` (`val` in Scala) visibility guarantees by the [Java Memory Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_memory_model). So it might have visibility issues in a multi-threaded context (e.g. you might end up with a `tail` being `null` when it shouldn't be). Which is probably why we see this in `ListBuffer#toList`:

```scala
override def toList: List[A] = {
  aliased = nonEmpty
  // We've accumulated a number of mutations to `List.tail` by this stage.
  // Make sure they are visible to threads that the client of this ListBuffer might be about
  // to share this List with.
  releaseFence()
  first
}
```

Yikes, they are adding a manual [memory barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier) üò≤ I guess it beats an O(n) reversal of a list. But this goes to show the necessity of coupling data structures with the methods operating on them.

> FP developers don't care about resources, because of the expectation that resources should be handled by the runtime, but sometimes that isn't possible or optimal ‚Äî even dumb data structures are resources and sometimes need special resource management, for efficiency reasons. In which case coupling the data with the methods operating on it is healthy üòâ

## Leaky Abstractions

OK, I'm going to be honest, there's a small chance that the memory barrier in `ListBuffer` may not be enough. Which is why I don't like manual memory barriers, as it means that the encapsulation is faulty (i.e. you don't control both the acquisition and the release). You should probably avoid doing this:

```scala
// Shared state
var list: List[Int] = Nil

// Thread 1: Producer
new Thread(new Runnable {
  def run() = {
    var x = 0
    while (true) {
      list = x :: list
      x += 1
      Thread.sleep(1000)
    }
  }
}).start()

// Thread 2: Consumer
new Thread(new Runnable {
  def run() = {
    while (true) {
      println(s"Consuming: $list")
      Thread.sleep(100)
    }
  }
}).start()
```

You don't necessarily have visibility guarantees here. In such instances you can probably still see a `tail` value that's `null`, which wouldn't have happened with a `tail` that had `final` (`val`) semantics. According to the JMM, this is because `var` values aren't guaranteed to be visible (from other threads) after a class constructor has finished building the object. So with `var` values inside a class, you can end up in situations in which the vars are not initialized yet from the point of view of other threads.

This probably doesn't matter much in practice, as you should probably not abuse shared vars like that.

<p class="info-bubble" markdown="1">
  Note that in this case a `@volatile` annotation might help, since it prevents reordering of the `list = ???` store with whatever var mutations that happened before it. So if a new `list` value becomes visible, then the writes that happened before it should be visible from other threads as well.

  But these things are so complicated, that I'm not 100% sure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è needs to be tested!
