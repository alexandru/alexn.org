<p class="intro withcap" markdown='1'>The venerable `Iterator` interface we all love and hate could use some improvements. This is a follow-up to my previous article, in which I talked about [getting rid of Traversable]({% link _posts/2017-01-13-traversable.md %}) because the `Iterable` and `Iterator` duo is enough for Scala's standard library.</p>

As a reminder, the `Iterator` interface is something like this:

```scala
trait Iterator[+A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A
}
```

It's a destructive interface that is consumed for as long as you call `next()`,
it obviously has "identity" and you're supposed to use it like this:

```scala
val cursor: Iterator[Int] = ???
var sum = 0

while (cursor.hasNext) {
  sum += cursor.next()
}
```

## Problem 1: Both methods (hasNext, next) are side-effecting

You could say that `hasNext` is not supposed to move the internal
cursor / pointer / index and thus it shouldn't be side-effecting, but
that's not true, because in many cases the only way to know if there
is a next element to be served is to trigger a side-effecting read.

And so the problem is that both `hasNext` and `next()` are side-effecting and
in my opinion the result of the wrong method is getting cached. When you work with
Functional Programming for a while, you start noticing when APIs have their
side-effects screwed ;-)

We can't really blame Scala though. This interface has been imported from
Java and kept similar probably for remaining familiar.

But let me illustrate by building an iterator for reading an `InputStream`:

```scala
class IteratorFromStream(in: InputStream, chunkSize: Int)
  extends Iterator[Array[Byte]] {

  private val buffer = new Array[Byte](chunkSize)
  private var chunk: Array[Byte] = _
  private var hasChunk = false

  def hasNext: Boolean = {
    if (!hasChunk) {
      val len = in.read(buffer)
      if (len >= 0) {
        chunk = util.Arrays.copyOf(buffer, len)
        hasChunk = true
      } else {
        in.close()
      }
    }

    hasChunk
  }

  def next(): Array[Byte] = {
    if (hasNext) {
      val ref = chunk
      chunk = null // GC purposes
      hasChunk = false
      ref
    } else {
      throw new NoSuchElementException("InputStream is empty")
    }
  }
}
```

Not that particularly exciting and you can see how `next()` has to duplicate
the work of `hasNext` and that `hasNext` itself is side-effecting, because
we have to read from the `InputStream` before being able to answer that question.

We can do better and we don't have to be original about it.
Behold the alternative inspired by
[IEnumerator from C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerator(v=vs.110).aspx):

```scala
trait Iterator[+A] {
  // Side-effecting, moves the cursor
  def moveNext(): Boolean

  // Not side-effecting, can be called multiple times
  def current: A
}
```

Usage is straightforward:

```scala
val cursor: Iterator[Int] = ???
var sum = 0

while (cursor.moveNext()) {
  sum += cursor.current
}
```

This interface feels more natural to developers because "moving" the
cursor is the side-effect, not reading the current value.
And here's how the above implementation changes:

```scala
class IteratorFromStream(in: InputStream, chunkSize: Int)
  extends Iterator[Array[Byte]] {

  private val buffer = new Array[Byte](chunkSize)
  private var chunk: Array[Byte] = _

  def moveNext(): Boolean = {
    val len = in.read(buffer)
    if (len >= 0) {
      chunk = util.Arrays.copyOf(buffer, len)
      true
    }
    else {
      chunk = null
      in.close()
      false
    }
  }

  def current: Array[Byte] = {
    if (chunk == null) throw NoSuchElementException("current")
    chunk
  }
}
```

Notice how this *simplifies* things on the implementation side as well.

**UPDATE:** M.Odersky points out in the comments that the standard library has a
[BufferedIterator](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/BufferedIterator.html)
implementation that caches the current `head` and can be used for convenience.

## Problem 2: Iterator comes with operations attached

At the beginning I gave you a simplified `Iterator` definition, however I lied.
The true `scala.collection.Iterator` is closer to this:

```scala
package scala.collection

trait Iterator[+A] extends TraversableOnce[A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A

  def isTraversableAgain = false
  def isEmpty: Boolean = !hasNext
  def hasDefiniteSize = isEmpty

  def map[B](f: A => B): Iterator[B] = ???
  def take(n: Int): Iterator[A] = slice(0, n)
  def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] = ???
  def slice(from: Int, until: Int): Iterator[A] = ???
  def map[B](f: A => B): Iterator[B] = ???
  def ++[B >: A](that: => GenTraversableOnce[B]): Iterator[B] = ???
  def flatMap[B](f: A => GenTraversableOnce[B]): Iterator[B] = ???
  def filter(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = ???
  def corresponds[B](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(p: (A, B) => Boolean): Boolean = ???
  def withFilter(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = ???
  def filterNot(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = ???
  def collect[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Iterator[B] = ???
  def scanLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) => B): Iterator[B] = ???
  def scanRight[B](z: B)(op: (A, B) => B): Iterator[B] = ???
  def takeWhile(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = ???
  def partition(p: A => Boolean): (Iterator[A], Iterator[A]) = ???
  def span(p: A => Boolean): (Iterator[A], Iterator[A]) = ???
  def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = ???
  def zip[B](that: Iterator[B]): Iterator[(A, B)] = ???
  def padTo[A1 >: A](len: Int, elem: A1): Iterator[A1] = ???
  def zipWithIndex: Iterator[(A, Int)] = ???
  def foreach[U](f: A => U) = ???
  def forall(p: A => Boolean): Boolean = ???
  def exists(p: A => Boolean): Boolean = ???
  def contains(elem: Any): Boolean = ???
  def find(p: A => Boolean): Option[A] = ???
  def indexWhere(p: A => Boolean): Int = ???
  def indexOf[B >: A](elem: B): Int = ???
  def buffered: BufferedIterator[A] = ???
  def grouped[B >: A](size: Int): GroupedIterator[B] = ???
  def copyToArray[B >: A](xs: Array[B], start: Int, len: Int): Unit = ???
  def sameElements(that: Iterator[_]): Boolean = ???
  def toTraversable: Traversable[A] = ???
  def toIterator: Iterator[A] = ???
  def toStream: Stream[A] = ???
  // ....
}
```

Well, at this point you should be thinking that this violates the principles of
OOP design. When `Iterator` comes with operations like `map` and `filter`,
that are polymorphic and can be overridden, it is no longer just a minimal
protocol for "*iterating over things*", but a *big, fat interface*.

You see, there isn't a single possible implementation for `map` or for `take`
and by providing such operations with a default implementation the
`Iterator` is imposing to users how those operations should behave.
Or more specifically:

1. these operations have lazy behavior, until overridden in subclasses
2. assume that the protocol is set in stone

But `Iterator` is a fine example of an OOP interface because you can add
restrictions to it. Lo and behold how OOP inheritance is supposed to work:

```scala
trait CloseableIterable[+A] extends Iterable[A] {
  def iterator: CloseableIterator[A]
}

trait CloseableIterator[+A] extends Iterator[A] with AutoCloseable {
  /** Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. */
  def close(): Unit
}
```

BAM, we just invalidated more than 80 operations provided by Scala's `Iterator`
and `Iterable`. Are you going to override them all?

If you say yes, then you don't know what you're getting yourself into,
plus what are you going to do when Scala 2.13 (or whatever the next version is)
comes with new operators that need to be overridden? Are you going to remember
to do it? It's a hard problem.

I don't mind having implementations of `map` and `filter` for `Iterator`, but
Scala lacks a minimal interface that provides just the raw protocol.
There is value in simplicity. Notice Java's [Iterator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html),
notice C#'s [IEnumerator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerator(v=vs.110).aspx), notice how they don't come with operators attached.
Instead, for C# at least, you can import
[Ix.NET](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET) in your project,
which gives you a bunch of extension methods you can work with, no strings attached.
Scala could also use [type-classes](http://typelevel.org/cats/) which are
much better than extension methods. But instead what currently happens in
Scala's collection library can be seen as *inheritance hell*.

Not everything needs `map` and `flatMap` on it.

**UPDATE:** there is now an issue for discussing this at
[collection-strawman/issues/#17](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/issues/17).

## Non-problem: early termination & resource handling

The `Iterator` interface alone is not enough to expose streams linked
to file handles, network sockets or other resources that need to be disposed
when terminated early.

So rookies (also because of problem 2 above) can end up with unconsumed iterators,
creating possible connection leaks, because it's easy:

```scala
iterator.take(100)
```

However I don't view this as being a problem because:

1. we don't need to do resource handling everywhere
2. as demonstrated in the sample with `CloseableIterator` above, you can build
   proper resource handling on top of `Iterator`
3. doing I/O by means of an `Iterator` is often a bad idea, given
   that `Iterator` is not capable of asynchronous boundaries, with
   I/O operations often being asynchronous

Having a `CloseableIterator` in the standard library wouldn't be bad though,
however given the very complex inheritance hierarchy and the traversable
grandparents, I'm afraid to wish for it.
