E.g., doing health-related searches on Google can jeopardize medical insurance or endanger minorities.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328114642/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508410114721697793">28 March 2022</a>: I wouldn’t attend a conference in which people make fun of other people’s illnesses or where violence, for whatever reason, is tolerated.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328113719/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407642032680970">28 March 2022</a>: Google is no longer my default search engine b/c I don’t trust them. It’s not good when a service you rely on can be your adversary. I still use it as a fallback, especially for programming-related or local searches.  Reasonable alternatives are DuckDuckGo or Brave Search.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328113719/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407642032680970">28 March 2022</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407640304631810">live</a>): Google is the best search engine by far, but on each search I have to think about the implications beforehand, given what Google may learn about me.  What weaknesses will expose me to financial loses or manipulation? What may constitute wrongthink in the future?</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220327101639/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025075185991681">27 March 2022</a>: There is a lot to criticize about cryptocurrency and its unregulated nature, which has fueled scams and which might trigger another financial crisis.  Even so, cryptocurrency is here to stay, long term, as it’s becoming a reaction to statism.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220327101639/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025075185991681">27 March 2022</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025073554399232">live</a>): One point of contention I have with crypto-skepticism is the idea that cryptocurrency is only useful for funding “crime”.  Whether you agree with the weaponization of the financial system or not, cryptocurrency is legitimized for funding “dissent” and dissent isn’t crime.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220327002135/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875317150584839">27 March 2022</a>: I’ll never understand the anti-intellectualism among devs.  For one, it closes your mind to new things. And even if you believe that a certain tool or paradigm or practice isn’t the best thing since GC, you can still be respectful, even mindful of other people &amp; their work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220327002135/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875317150584839">27 March 2022</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875315502170113">live</a>): Almost all improvements in CS are incremental, but add up. E.g. Future/Promise was a marginal improvement over callbacks, yet by now most people avoid callbacks.  It’s fine to show enthusiasm for marginal improvements. We’re builders, taking pride in our craftsmanship.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220326081701/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507632409461891077">26 March 2022</a>: I’m not fond of Romania’s Christianity, BTW. People practice a lot of traditions and customs (churchisms), but there’s less learned Christian ethics. I guess that serves a purpose too, but I sense a potential for toxic nationalism during crises.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220326081033/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507630615558070275">26 March 2022</a>: Religion is in human nature. Atheism, at least the non-agnostic kind, is a religion too, defined in terms of Christianity, often focusing on man’s own ability to evolve (another religion) — found this book by John Gray on “7 types of atheism” interesting: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36482672-seven-types-of-atheism</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567">25 March 2022</a>: What separates liberal democracies from dictatorships? Why aren’t all countries devolving?  Is it wealth, education, rule of law? What systemic processes helped democracies in achieving these, and aren’t we destroying them by converging on authoritarianism?  End 🧵</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567">25 March 2022</a>: It’s easy to just ban disent, no trial necessity. Out of sight, out of mind, burn those books, problem solved /s</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567">25 March 2022</a>: We’re losing the information war, and the way governments, activists, or Big Tech choose to fight is censorship, which is iliberal and always has unintended consequences.  We’re using the tools of dictators, of losers, but that authoritarian siren is strong.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567">25 March 2022</a>: Phrases for spotting most conspiracy theories in 21st century:  - “You’ve been lied to” - “Corporate interests”  This describes, for example: - every fad diet; - anti-vaxxing; - putinism; - flat earth; - QAnon; - most recent Russell Brand videos;</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220324130001/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506978845450293256">24 March 2022</a>: My opinion is that they fear a direct NATO intervention (e.g. closing the sky) so they are threatening with the escalation everyone fears. However I was also of the opinion that Russia won’t invade Ukraine, as it would be a pretty dumb and irrational move, and yet they proceeded.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220324054159/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506868801215901697">24 March 2022</a>: Hearing flanger or phaser sound effects applied on a singer’s voice is unappealing, as I ended up associating such effects with not having a good singing voice 🤔</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220323191737/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506711592154578945">23 March 2022</a>: Carbohydrate-insulin model is dishonest quackery.  If you want to get lean by reliving a glorious past, go back to 19th century and work the land to exhaustion, feeling hungry most of the time. Living in USSR or during WW2 works too. Also give up meat &amp; fat, it was too expensive.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220323191737/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506711592154578945">23 March 2022</a>: “The Big Fat Surprise” is a book describing a conspiracy theory of why people got fat. And it’s absolute bullshit.  This quackery has been believed, even promoted by well known programmers. We aren’t immune to BS; not much of a difference compared to anti-vaxing or homeopathy. https://twitter.com/MrSollozzo/status/1506239292175118336</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220323155651/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506661103706812422">23 March 2022</a>: In  #Akka  Streams, is there a way to make those streams log something whenever buffers are full and it goes into back-pressure?  Asking a friend 🙂</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221702/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506394402612260872">22 March 2022</a>: And I admit my view may be naive, but I wouldn’t necessarily say “equality good, inequality bad,” as it’s a complex problem.  I love the equality in Nordic European countries, BTW. But we can’t ignore the geopolitical reasons behind their wealth, not easy to reproduce.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221310/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506393410822975489">22 March 2022</a>: I mean, I may be mad at China’s human rights violations, but I can’t be anything but happy to see their middle-class growing (due to unscrupulous businessmen, no less). Ditto for Vietnam, India, etc.  We need to pull all people out of poverty in order to tackle world problems.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221041/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506392721170350083">22 March 2022</a>: US citizens will rightly point out that the standard of living and wages in the US are stagnating since 20th century. Such numbers are misleading due to population growth, but even if true … there is also wealth redistribution to poorer countries due to outsourcing…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220738/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506392091227787278">22 March 2022</a>: This idea that wealth should be measured by standards of living, instead of stashed money, isn’t new. Adam Smith was a proponent.  Rich people get richer due to re-invenvesting their wealth (just like the state), which creates further innovation and even jobs (with caveats)…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220521/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506391511017078795">22 March 2022</a>: When Marx noticed the poor working conditions of the proletariat in factories, he was right, except he didn’t take into account the population explosion, as people were no longer starving to death.  Does it matter if we have inequality, given people’s lives are much better?…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220254/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506390905502187529">22 March 2022</a>: It depends on perspective.  In feudalism/slavery, for people to get rich, they had to take from the poor as the pie was constant.  The industrial revolution changed the paradigm due to innovation, which is growing the pie…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322212229/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506380703612735496">22 March 2022</a>: I think public education and public healthcare are a must, BTW.  And social democracy isn’t communism.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322212101/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506380333813489665">22 March 2022</a>: Education, BTW, is never a right but a privilege. It’s awesome to have public education, but it consumes resources, and to receive public education, this means someone else is forced to provide it. So, it only works as long as people can pay for it. Usually, the West can manage.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211857/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506379723089367041">22 March 2022</a>: Individualism means the rights of  individuals. These are rights humans are born with, that the state should protect.  Like being free (instead of being slave) or ability to speak up (w/o being deported), or ability to move, or to practice whatever trade you want…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211421/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506378649796231170">22 March 2022</a>: I should also add:  3. Rule of law;  People say that USSR failed b/c it evolved from feudalism, so it was corrupted. I think you can’t have a rule of law w/o individualism, which means freedom of speech or private property that are antithetical to “ultimate” social orders.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211030/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506377707491373062">22 March 2022</a>: The distinguishing features of political ideologies that we can live with should be..  1. Individualism; 2. Pluralism;  Democracy is basically a struggle b/w the left pushing for equality and the right pushing for freedom, the 2 goals being opposite, democracy providing balance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322210512/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506376374449319940">22 March 2022</a>: The spectrum from social democracy to whatever you understand by neoliberalism is all good for now, as long as we have liberal democracy and market economy (as opposed to the command economy).  I’ll refrain from predicting an ultimate social order, as only radicals do that…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322192332/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506350742894002186">22 March 2022</a>: I should stop now – end 🧵🙂</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322191634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506349060080476170">22 March 2022</a>: In former comunist Romania too, although we didn’t kill our bourgeoisie, we just imprisoned them in labor camps or deported them, forever labeling their families as pariah (e.g. their children unable to attend school), where bourgeoisie included peasants w/ a piece of land.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322191634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506349060080476170">22 March 2022</a>: For completeness, I was informed that Marx’s quote may be an inaccurate combination of Marx+Engels.  Bad source. I am familiar w/ his work, esp the class-strugle view of history, which was turned by Lenin up a notch, responsible for literal class war. https://otaviopinto.com/index.php/2016/08/04/did-marx-write-this/</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322185500/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506343646341304329">22 March 2022</a>: It happened in comunist Romania too BTW, although we didn’t kill our bourgeoisie, we just deported them or imprisoned them in re-education camps, forever labeling them and their families as pariah (where bourgeoisie soon became all peasants that had a piece of land).</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322185300/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506343027027107848">22 March 2022</a>: I was informed that the quote by Marx may be an inaccurate combination of Marx and Engels.  The class struggle theory is Marx’s creation, though, which  Lenin turned up a notch, as overthrowing the old world order couldn’t come soon enough. https://otaviopinto.com/index.php/2016/08/04/did-marx-write-this/</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714">22 March 2022</a>: Communism is poison.  Russia may no longer be communist, but it’s still haunted by the ghost of communism.  Also, the big communist country that still stands is performing genocides of its own, as we speak, while we keep doing business as usual.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714">22 March 2022</a>: Karl Marx was basically a theorist of political genocide, one of the first, and you’ve got European and US leaders still celebrating him and his legacy.  When people promote Marx’s theories, they are promoting an ideology that killed tens of millions of innocents.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714">22 March 2022</a>: At the heart of communism is the class struggle, and communism, just like fascism, is fixated on creating a “new man”.  “The classes and the races too weak to master the new conditions of life must give way.” They must “perish in the revolutionary holocaust” — Karl Marx</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714">22 March 2022</a>: Nazism was based on false biology, while communism was based on false sociology, both “scientific”.  It’s why USSR is being discredited as “not a true communism”, all such attempts boiling down to a “no true Scotsman” fallacy, but it’s just the difference b/w dreams and reality.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714">22 March 2022</a>: Communism killed more people than Nazism, Stalin killed more people than Hitler, even the Holocaust was preceded by Holodomor (in which 10 million Ukrainians were killed by famine).  Only one of these monsters / ideologies / countries were universally condemned. 🧵</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321134402/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505902833010364419">21 March 2022</a>: It happened in Romania too 😔 i.e. ex-communists that were part of the oppression apparatus to become leaders after the revolution.  If it weren’t for the EU integration, we’d be screwed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: I wish for Russia to become a democratic member of the EU and for us to prosper together in peace.  But for that to happen, its post-WW2 identity must be crushed, and communism must be condemned; otherwise, we’ll never have peace, imperialist Russia behaving like a tidal wave.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Putin is an ex-KGB that was trained to hate everything about the West. Can you imagine a former Gestapo or Stasi agent becoming chancellor of Germany after WW2? You can’t because it’s not possible.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: I’ll also add that Putin is possible because we never condemned comunism, we never demanded an apology from Russia.  Germany, Japan, they apologized for WW2; they condemned their mistakes, and we’ve moved on. But not Russia.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Soviet Russia also squashed dissent inside the Iron Curtain by invading with their army. Like when they invaded Czechoslovakia for becoming too liberal, or Hungary for revolting.  USSR or the Iron Curtain fell because revolts happened without the Russian army showing up!</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Romanians were no angels in WW2, we participated in the Holocaust and in operation Barbarossa.  Our “liberators,” however, plundered, murdered and raped, then exploited our resources for years, something which happened throughout Eastern Europe.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Romania has a long history w/ imperialist Russia. They “liberated” us since the Ruso-Turkish wars, yet they behaved like an occupational army, plundering, murdering peasants, raping women.  Romania happened w/ sponsorship of France/UK as a buffer, b/c Romanians hated Russians.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Molotov-Ribbentrop is no singular event of Soviet-Nazi cooperation. In fact, the nazi army was rebuilt between 1922 – 1933 at secret bases in USSR.   Stalin and other soviet leaders wanted to destabilize Europe. Stalin’s Russia had no issue w/ nazism until they were invaded.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234">21 March 2022</a>: Russia has forgotten the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which quite literally divided Poland b/w Germany and Russia. We, the Romanians, know it as that’s how Stalin occupied Bessarabia too (current Moldova).  Their whole post-WW2 national identity, that of nazi liberators, is a lie. 🧵 https://twitter.com/maxfras/status/1505845102811533313</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317174623/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504514414090887168">17 March 2022</a>: I didn’t say anything about wanting it to be mandatory &amp; investing in mutual funds might be better, as public pension depends on population.  Milenials got out of communism w/o financial ed, they work on the black market, they don’t save and I’m foreseeing a lot of homelessness.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317163008/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504495234457247750">17 March 2022</a>: Not sure about other places, but I wouldn’t get more money with contracting, versus regular employment.  A lot of taxes are paid on my salary, around 42%, however 25% is for the public social security system. And if I’d contract, for earning more I’d end up paying VAT 19%.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317162912/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504494908559826948">17 March 2022</a>: &gt; b2b doesn’t necessarily mean being a contractor  But it does, as that’s what your contract says. Everything else is handshake trust, which tends to not be much, as the company you’re working for is not your family.  Nvm that most people are not saving in a retirement fund…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317140906/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504426236436692992">17 March 2022</a>: I don’t disagree 😢 War needs goals too though (something which US lacked in Afghanistan for example). I sometimes think a direct confrontation with NATO to push the Russian army back would have been better, but I may be talking nonsense.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317114822/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504421016075911172">17 March 2022</a>: Two things conspire against revolt:  1. Russia is controlled by a secret police that now terrorizes the population; 2. Strict control of information using modern tools / massive censorship;  Most westerners have never lived under such conditions, or their parents.</li>

You can be a shareholder only in a democratic country.  I think Russians have shared responsibility for what happened, but that will only matter as a learning lesson, as changing the course of this war is still out of their control.</li>

Citizenship doesn’t matter, as it’s not necessarily a personal choice, and citizens may or may not be able to revolt. Targeting citizenship with sanctions is dehumanizing, and with no clear goal of defunding the war machine, it doesn’t even work.</li>

The world will start switching to alternatives. These sanctions, as needed as they are to stop the war, just legitimized cryptocoins…</li>

The state can simply nationalize everything. Economic sanctions will make life harder for Russians, it’s undeniable. But the war machine won’t be affected by canceling Dostoevsky or by foreign companies refusing to do business w/ Russians.</li>

Socialism tends to be a command economy, where the state ignores market signals, regulation going against free market, generating second-order effects, like huge inflation.  2022 is going to be another fun year.</li>

A consequence of Europe’s forced move to renewables while closing nuclear plants, a situation flavored w/ COVID-19 restrictions and Russian gambles.  What do governments do? Price caps.

Management does not want to hurt customers. This is sort of a strawman.  Think hard about all the colleagues you ever had. How many were willing to go beyond their job description, to file or fix bugs in OSS, even when employer would allow it?</li>

Outsourcing is exactly what a union will try to prevent. If you say such unions should be global, good luck w/ that.</li>

In other words companies can have a harder time finding the resources needed to make better products.</li>

What I know is what happened in Romania before and after 1990 (the fell of communism). You can’t fix starvation with handouts IMO. What a country needs is an economy first, and education is in support of that.</li>

Not sure how it is elsewhere, but in the poor rural parts of Romania, people would like better jobs &amp; infrastructure, not food handouts.</li>

To deny access to resources for some groups, in the hope that other groups will be able to compete for those resources. It’s what happened in practice w/ 20th century’s communism.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211208130240/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1468565311234449414"> 8 December 2021</a>: Equality of opportunity is more achievable. You provide the tools, the infrastructure for YouTube creators to be successful, regardless of background, and let them create. But this will yield inequality of outcome, based on individual merits alone. You will not get equity.</li>

I think money muddies the water, as not all wealth earned is based on merit. However think popularity.   A YouTube creator that’s successful will earn influence. How can you create equity in this space? Distribute views &amp; likes?</li>

By equity I understand equality of outcome, which may actually be at odds with equality of opportunity. Nothing wrong w/ dreaming of a better world, but seems to me that dreams of equity is how we got the horrors of communism from 20th century.</li>

This is due to a viewpoint conflict about government, justice, progress, etc.  Democracy eventually reaches consensus on most issues, always seeking equilibrium, never achieving it due to new problems.</li>

Governments did a poor job in this pandemic to educate people. Also remember the screw-ups (masks, AstraZeneca).</li>

Valid content already gets buried by overzealous people reporting it.  Facebook censored the “napalm girl” picture for nudity. It routinely censors history based on keywords.</li>

And I think people talking about mortality in this pandemic have missed a very important angle — young people may not die at a high rate, but they are affected by “long COVID-19”.

We are socially responsible every time we leave home, and it’s not just b/c of penal code.

Freedom of speech, interestingly, in the US was a virtue of the left (e.g in the 60s). It can’t be claimed by either side.

You can say that this enables crime. But cash enables crime too, cash being on its way out. Do we really want all transactions tracked by the state?  And not all crime is immoral. One case is SciHub being banned by PayPal, now accepting Bitcoin.</li>

The empirical observations we have are pretty weak IMO, and the pieces I read are mostly emotional reactions, poor inductions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716102130/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415979848414150663">16 July 2021</a>: I have a conservative mindset, I believe in justice, in assumption of innocence, in having your day in court.  But what happens when there’s a clear pattern of injustice? Vigilantism is inevitable, as the state (w/ its monopoly on violence) fails to protect the innocent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716102130/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415979848414150663">16 July 2021</a>: In my country, only 1 in 5 reports of rape end up being trialed in a court of law, or only 1 in 7 reports of sex w/ minors or sexual abuses (harassment, aggression, etc). These are trails, not convictions.   public shaming may be weaponized, but is entirely justified.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210714202634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415403044800446468">14 July 2021</a>: Capitalism doesn’t work unrestrained, being centrist as a concept. Adam Smith for example wasn’t against regulation to keep the market free. If I remember correctly,  he was saying that when business owners meet they immediately start conspiring for bending the rules.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210714160320/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415341100735344640">14 July 2021</a>: Note I’m not against regulation, I’m against preemptive regulation.  If we see fraud in the wild, then regulation is maybe needed, but a posteriori, not a priori.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210714144759/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415322169765138434">14 July 2021</a>: Capitalism needs a legal framework to work. There is no such thing as “wild west capitalism”, adding adjectives to the noun isn’t valid.  Avoiding regulation isn’t necessarily bad, as regulations also protect monopolies &amp; hamper innovation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210714132325/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415300838579396610">14 July 2021</a>: 3/3 — Are cryptocoins a Ponzi scheme?  Maybe. Some applications &amp; coins definitely are. Still not a good reason for banning it, even if some regulation might be ok. We’re responsible adults, not dogs on a leash.  I don’t own any cryptocoins, or have any stake in it.</li>

But banning concrete causes for CO2 emissions is stupid &amp; will not solve climate issues. The right solution is to incentivise the market to optimize for low CO2 emissions. Make it profitable &amp; market will follow.</li>

Arguments against cryptocoins are essentially against capitalism &amp; innovation. Can’t agree w/ calls for banning it.</li>

I’m not so sure that there is a difference b/w believers and non-believers in religion.  Conspiracy theories seem to me to be coming from a different place … mistrusting authority. Just a hunch.</li>

I think that both assumptions you’re making are wrong. Millenials are aged 25 - 40. I’ve seen plenty of those in the Capitol riots.  Q’s source is 4chan AFAIK. How many boomers are on 4chan?</li>

Human mind is wired for religion. Atheism, as commonly practiced, is a religion born of and defined by Christianity.  And what are ideologies? They surely aren’t science.</li>

We thrived in this economy, the poor haven’t.  And before quoting some BS study w/ a mathematical model from last year, stop &amp; think of how strong that evidence is.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 7/ I also take issue with the tendency to keep people on a leash. We need solidarity, but when enforced, when it leads to suffering, people stop trusting authority.  We can have freedom &amp; personal responsibility too, now that we have plenty of masks and vaccines.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 6/ I understand the calls for keeping lockdown, but it’s been odd to see privileged, middle-class software developers, that can afford to work remotely, call for lockdown w/ total disregard for the inevitable casualties, the poor.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 5/ Government handouts, restrictions that slow down economy … these lead to public debt, which leads to more money printed, which, when not backed by economic growth leads to inflation, which is a tax on everyone, hitting the poor hardest, due to higher prices for basics.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 4/ Romania’s economy has grown actually, but that’s b/c we had to terminate restrictions early. We have a higher death rate unfortunately, but higher poverty is still a risk for this country, and poverty kills too, albeit indirectly, being hard to measure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 3/ Also conspiracies have flourished everywhere, in mirror of the media panic, with the result being we now have a really poor vaccination rate (compared w/ capacity or other countries).  Conspiracies, burned budget, that’s the result of lockdowns promoted by the privileged.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 2/ The result was that we burned our budget, we aren’t Germany to keep people at home indefinitely, so we couldn’t have another lockdown in Winter 2020, when we recorded more deaths in a single month than in any other month since WWII.  We also closed schools too early.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706142020/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412415989560528911"> 6 July 2021</a>: 1/ I think ending lockdown and other restrictions is, for the time being,  the right thing to do 🤷‍♂️  In Romania the lockdown from spring 2020 was stupid – too early to flatten the curve, too late to suppress the virus. Media was filled w/ panic porn &amp; poor judgments were made.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705222931/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412176796532068360"> 5 July 2021</a>: Affiliation to ideas is always subjective, this isn’t science, political philosophy is not science, which is why we call them ideologies, and in democracy we expect pluralism.  This “you’re either with me or against me” attitude is polarizing and anti-democratic.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705222213/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412174928108036096"> 5 July 2021</a>: We understand the world via abstractions and start from different first principles, which is why there are always 2 widely different viewpoints on any issue.  On COVID-19, lefties want state-imposed solidarity &amp; restrictions, which the right rejects out of principle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705150222/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1412064253163544576"> 5 July 2021</a>: Imdeed. Monix’s ConcurrentQueue is pure and based on a better queue implementation than ConcurrentMap BTW.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 25/25 — it is often said that being a conservative requires imagination &amp; education.  The socialist story of human selfishness and oppression of the many to the benefit of the few … is much simpler, attractive, but wrong, and like all BS, the refutation requires more effort.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 24/ Liberal democracy is the political equivalent of capitalism BTW, the two go hand in hand.  Democracy is a marketplace for your electoral vote. It’s not perfect, but it does a really good job to keep a balance b/w equality &amp; freedom, and to isolate extremism by vote.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 23/ At the same time the idea that you can have a centrally planned economy, which is what socialists think, has yielded disasters.  And state interventions in economy have arguably done more harm than good, prolonging economic crises, creating more inequality.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 22/ Capitalism is what you get when you let people self-organize, but with a legal framework that protects their property and the market’s freedom. You can’t have capitalism w/o a free market, entrepreneurial education, and the rule of law.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 21/ Innovation requires entrepreneurship (risk taking), and the free market.  A free market economy is one that’s always seeking equilibrium, but never reaching it, due to innovation giving birth to competition. And the invisible hand tying it all is self-interest.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 20/ This isn’t too say that the public sector can’t innovate at all. It can (e.g the Internet), but that often happens in concert w/ private entities. It can’t be relied on, as we’ve seen in former USSR &amp; satellites. In communist Romania consumerism felt like progress &amp; freedom.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 19/ If you’re reading this, you’re probably a software developer. If you aren’t a startup founder or executive at a big co, why aren’t you?  Be honest here — you hate the associated risk, and our salaries are high enough for us to not want to risk our well-being.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 18/ Innovation implies taking risks. 9 out of 10 startups fail &amp; we only hear of black swans w/ exaggerated returns on investment, but not about the ones that fail.  The working class only risks their salary, whereas the entrepreneur often risks their entire fortune.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 17/ Going back to the zero-sum game, Marx’s theory is flawed b/c it discounts innovation and what makes it happen.  Obviously value-added (profit) is not an exploitation factor. The device I use to write this message is a direct refutation of Marx’s theory.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 16/ There’s also this paradox … when all people own something, nobody is responsible for it.  “Tragedy of the commons” is interpreted as a problem of selfishness, when it’s in fact one of ownership.  E.g we have a CO2 problem b/c it’s an externality, a subsidy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 15/ And if robots can 100% satisfy the needs of humans, surely they’ll develop consciousness and will need rights too, otherwise we’re talking slavery 🤷‍♂️</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 14/ I mean, sure, some will, we evolved to work &amp; we might become sick w/o it. If exercise for its own sake was doable for all, we wouldn’t have an obesity problem. Depending on people’s goodwill to work won’t feed and satisfy billions of people, unless we depend 100% on robots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 13/ In the words of Adam Smith, Bernard Mandeville, others — selfishness is good actually 🙂 as people cooperate for the public good, out of a desire to fulfill their private interest.  This is one flaw of Marxism. People will not work for work’s sake. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Mandeville</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 12/ Capitalism is a complex system that can’t be easily described, but according to Adam Smith it needs:  — free commerce — division of labor — an invisible hand making people cooperate for public good  This invisible hand is private interest, aka selfishness.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 11/ Not all ideologies are equal. Some are more rooted in reality than others.  Some ideologies appeal to altruism for achieving our potential, while others recognize that we are imperfect beings and work within those constraints.  Some default to equality, others to liberty.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 10/ A very democratic principle is that for practical purposes there is no absolute truth. People know their self-interest and should be allowed to affiliate to ideas that serve them, but such affiliations are subjective. Which is why we call them ideologies, not sciences.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 8/ What is his labor theory of value missing?  A lot actually. It’s important to realize that ideologies are abstractions, theories built on first principles that distort the real world, and the details ignored may be important. Which is why it is easy to make mistakes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 7/ If Marxism sounds ridiculous, that’s because it is. He was not an economist in any traditional sense, his predictions and theories coming from flawed inference from history.  For example he totally missed an analysis of capitalism being the free market economy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 6/ Marx was actually an admirer of capitalism, and its strength to end outdated traditions, as a force for reform. However he was hoping for the same creatively destructive force to be embodied in communism. And he seemed to be clueless about why capitalism works.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 5/ He then proceeded to imagine communism as the final solution for the welfare of society and human happiness, ironically perhaps being his inspiration from the primitive communities of hunter-gatherers. He was a primitivist. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 4/ How could capitalism not end, when it’s characterized by this structural antagonism b/w the bourgeoisie and the proletariat? Eventually those oppressed and exploited will realize that they have the power, and will rise. Via revolution, which communists took very seriously.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 3/ Marx is arguably a decent philosopher of history, which is why he fascinates.  According to him historical ages are characterized by their economic system: primitive community, slavery, feudalism, and now capitalism, which will end by necessity, according to him.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 2/ According to Marx in capitalism people are divided in those with the means of production, the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and those selling their labor, the proletariat.  Difference b/w production cost and selling price, aka profit, for him is the exploitation factor.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704131507/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681"> 4 July 2021</a>: 1/ More bad takes on Marxism 🙂  Marx explains capitalism as being an economic system under which the rich become rich by taking from the poor. In his vision,  and that of many socialists, economy is a zero-sum game — in order for someone to win, somebody else has to lose. https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203155720253441</li>

  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701091933/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410479602837954561"> 1 July 2021</a>: Does GitHub’s Copilot analyze closed source, private projects too?   If not, then why not? I thought the code is “synthesized”.  Or is it because public projects are trapped due to social status, such that authors are unable to move?</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 24/24 — People are enamored with Marxism because it’s a fairy tale for grown-ups, but is unfortunately one that has led to horrors, and us living in Easter Europe we’ve seen the actual difference b/w this fairy tale and real life.  /end</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 23/ Russian Revolution supposedly happened in an underdeveloped country, whereas Marx’s vision was for the proletariat to rise in an industrialized one, such as England.  Marxists are obsessed w/ forging a “new man”, much like fascists, but w/ a slightly different story to tell.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 22/ Marxists keep moving the goal-posts, thus making the theory non-falsifiable.  They also say the horrors we’ve seen in communism mustn’t be due to Marxism, as communism wasn’t implemented according to Marx’s ideals. Which is factually untrue, all major elements being there.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 21/ The rise of the proletariat never happened, instead the proletariat vanished. Now neo-marxists are coming up w/ all sorts of wild theories for why that is, like people being corrupted by consumerism (aka progress), coupled w/ socialists being crushed in a global conspiracy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 20/ This is why I don’t really pay attention to the right-wing moaning about “political correctness”, even if bringing down statues is stupid, and something communists used to do too. Although, I’d watch out for the (sometimes faux) Marxist leaders of progressive movements.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 19/ Speaking of the class struggle, the emancipation of minorities and identity politics, while aligned a little with Marxism, it is not Marxist, as identity politics goes against the solidarity that Marxism preaches, and detracts from the real class struggle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 18/ Our bipolar society tends to group communism w/ social democracy, and fascism w/ conservatism. But in fact, contemporary social democracy &amp; conservatism have more in common than they do w/ the extremes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 17/ Communism and fascism are actually twins, born in the same revolutionary fire of 19th century, when people thought the world must evolve through violence. It is disappointing for Marxists everywhere that World-War-I was b/w states and not classes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 16/ Populism? Anti-intellectualism? In communism, for sure, because shared hatred for the rich, the privileged, the competent is stronger than any solidarity Marx could envision. The class struggle naturally begets hatred, and any revolution demands blood spilled.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 15/ Communism is supposed to be this post-money, post-state, ordered anarchy. In practice people need a one-party system, banning pluralism, deprecating other parties, sending their members to reeducation camps. The so-called “people’s consciousness” that administers all capital.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 14/ Speaking of, fascism is said to be a far-right ideology b/c during the French Revolution the right was advocating to keep the monarch’s veto power, to keep totalitarianism. Interestingly, totalitarianism is also the consequence if capital is abolished.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 13/ Communists managed to destroy whole communities, neighborhoods, cities, replacing concrete individual human happiness w/ a very abstract one that was never materialized. There’s no greater evil in politics than abstract thinking.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 12/ This is in general a problem with many ideologies, this idea that people can’t be happy without the state constantly intervening in their lives. People just want to be left alone (aka freedom), in spite of our tendency for prescribing how other people should live.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 11/ Note that private ownership is subtle. Beyond the law, beyond capital or knowledge, your own body, thoughts, feelings are also private property. A hallmark of extremism is the idea that people need to be dictated what to do with their own body, what to think, how to live.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 10/ On capital, some is inherited, but some is earned. Abolishing private property strikes at the heart of humanity. Without private property, all other civil liberties will fall, as there can be no freedom or dignity without it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 9/ Wealth transfers now happen across state barriers too, bidirectionally. We have a looming future that always speaks of Armageddon (we now talk of global warming, last century there was the nuclear war threat), yet we are living humanity’s best years, literally.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 8/ People will rightly point out that the standards of living in the US haven’t increased in decades. Which is worrying, but the standards of living have been raised all across the globe. Before the pandemic, hunger, malnutrition, poverty were at an all-time low.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 7/ Marxists will also say that capitalism has kept growing due to imperialism, expanding in other markers, etc. There is truth when talking of negative effects of imperialism, but we’re now talking of wealth transfers b/w first world and developing countries, in both directions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 6/ Marxists are also criticizing capitalism’s need for constant growth, saying it is unsustainable. But the biggest elephant in the room is that the population is growing, which is what is actually driving the economic growth (and other implications, such as global warming).</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 5/ The specialization that Marx criticizes is also what allows for the economy to be efficient. Specialization is a form of capital, as people learn a trade, allowing them to fulfil their private interests. And you couldn’t feed billions of people w/o this efficiency.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 4/ Marx talks of the proletariat’s alienation, being cogs in the machine. In communism, people are supposed to work for work’s sake. Adam Smith on the other hand rightly points out that the baker doesn’t serve you out of the goodness of his heart, but due to a private interest.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 3/ Marx’s labor theory of value is ignoring the risk posed by capital owners, and how that is tied to continued innovation. Given Marx’s entire philosophy is around the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat, this puts it in serious doubt.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 2/ What follows are a bunch of bad takes for why Marxism is bullshit 😅 …</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630114723/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203151618220038">30 June 2021</a>: 1/ I was listening to a YouTube vid on Marxism. Guy is saying that Marxism hasn’t failed b/c it doesn’t propose a solution, being a critique of capitalism that’s still valid.  Alarms went off. I’m like, buddy, it’s precisely Marx’s critique of capitalism that’s deeply flawed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630062007/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410120871549849601">30 June 2021</a>: The reason I tend to dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand is that the probability is higher for the truth to be the mundane and boring alternative.  Life is chaotic. Such theories are born b/c we feel we’ll regain control if we’ll expose the puppeteers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626172634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408839069845577729">26 June 2021</a>: It’s like with the anti-vaxxers and other conspiracy theorists,  when you have to address their true feelings first (fears), instead of correcting their misconceptions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626172456/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408838685106315272">26 June 2021</a>: Yeah, it’s a hard situation. I sense ignorance in these people too. Not necessarily hate. Not all of them are nazis, the problem is people pick up wrong ideas about normality and biology or science, then repeat them.  I wonder if there are deradicalization techniques…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626171906/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408837132421152771">26 June 2021</a>: This reply was supposed to be for your first message 🙂</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626171350/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408835836339265536">26 June 2021</a>: Interesting thought. Care to explain?  Problem w/ forums like Facebook is that a lot of moderates on the fence are watching. I don’t care about those spewing hate, but about their audience, which is why I get this burning desire to intervene, so hoping for sustainability.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626171101/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408835095738437639">26 June 2021</a>: I have LGBT+ friends, thanks to the Internet, I’m already sold.  But reminding people that we’re talking about humans with hopes and dreams is a good strategy. A problem is when we talk freaking metaphysics, in the abstract.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626175707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408831529883680771">26 June 2021</a>: 3/3 – How can you keep your cool and win hearts in such debates? I mean, besides knowing what you’re talking about.  I’d appreciate advice (books, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626175707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408831529883680771">26 June 2021</a>: 2/3 – The problem with my country is that the phenomenon is new. Until 2001 gay people could go to jail.  There’s a lot of ignorance, people feel their identity threatened, they fear western “depravity”, they have “concerns” …</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210626175707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408831529883680771">26 June 2021</a>: 1/3 – There are ongoing debates about gender identity on my Facebook feed.  People that are calmly pushing back against bigotry with reason, humility and keep their patience and kindness are my heroes.  Personally I can’t. I get mad, condescension takes over and it’s game over…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210625060351/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408304860043296774">25 June 2021</a>: BTW, historically speaking liberals &amp; conservatives have been the biggest enemies of fascists. But there are multiple flavors and due to right-wing parties converging we now have populists catering to the ultraorthodox and obsessing about what people do w/ their own bodies…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210625054957/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408301318826045440">25 June 2021</a>: Conservatives are talking of far-left extremism, but numbers don’t lie, there is almost no left extremism to speak of.  Whereas the far-right is on the rise all over Europe. Kind of hard to worry about leftist cultural revolution when we’ve got actual fascists in our Parliament.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210625054301/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408299602072195075">25 June 2021</a>: As for legislation look for example at how many countries have passed or are trying to pass anti-abortion or anti-LGBT legislation.  In Romania conservatives are fighting tooth and nail to prevent sexual education in schools, to “protect” children from gender identity.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210625053808/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408298380028223488">25 June 2021</a>: I’m a liberal conservative 👋  France is a very socialist country. Look instead at Poland, Hungary, or the UK even. Also some parties are supposedly social democrat but have ultraconservative social policies, e.g PSD in Romania.  80%+ of hate crimes, of terorism, is right wing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624121652/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408029044323594240">24 June 2021</a>: Bigotry can be born out of ignorance, and fear — of change, of the future, of those that are different. We all have that potential for bigotry. Recognizing it and its nature is important IMO for combating it.  It’s such a good word. Too bad we don’t really have it in Romanian.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624110222/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408017580154048516">24 June 2021</a>: You can feel offended by bigotry, but I think you misunderstood my point — a  political stance is worse, because this leads to activism.  It can also be very confusing for people, as many bigoted statements do not in fact signal hatred, being merely “concerns”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624105526/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408015854462193664">24 June 2021</a>: As a centrist, I worry about the left’s cultural revolution and cancel culture, but let’s get one thing straight … the ongoing problem of last decade has been the far-right.  Most hate crimes, or fake news, or new legislation impeding freedoms is right-wing (aka conservative).</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624103040/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408009644811898881">24 June 2021</a>: Bigotry isn’t hatred, even if correlated. Bigotry is prejudice against a group of people.  Bigotry isn’t an offense, but a political stance, triggering reactionism against the rights of those groups. It’s a stance against equality, against treating all people as human beings.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617065547/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405418853081960449">17 June 2021</a>: You have to consider that medical research in such instances is difficult, since we can’t purposefully infect people w/ Sars-Cov-2 in a controlled setting, as that would be immoral. And there are many safety checks in place, ensuring proposed treatments are effective &amp; safe.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617065344/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405418294031626241">17 June 2021</a>: When the dust settles, I think we’ll realize that COVID-19 research was conducted in record time. And that’s actually an argument used by anti-vaxxers, as if steps were skipped. It’s only been 1 year and a half since the outbreak.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617063050/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405412588813422594">17 June 2021</a>: COVID-19 research is a global phenomenon. In the EU we couldn’t care less about Trump.  Speaking of, Trump also suggested “hitting the body with a tremendous ultraviolet or very powerful light” or injecting disinfectant, as possible cures that he found very interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617061033/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405407452246560769">17 June 2021</a>: What happened was the mass media wanted to believe in a miracle drug, b/c it makes for good headlines, and we (the public) eventually found that there is no such miracle cure. Trump wanted to believe that, too, b/c his initial handling of COVID-19 was a disaster.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617053745/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405399204802052101">17 June 2021</a>: This study is an observational one &amp; size is small for its kind.  Large, randomized, controlled clinical trials showed no benefits to using hydroxychloroquine, a drug that also gives heart rhythm problems.  Recommendation wasn’t wrong based on available information.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612161452/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403741259857006597">12 June 2021</a>: Ah, well, US’s republicans have been going down the path of conspiracy theories. Such a shame.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612161452/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403741259857006597">12 June 2021</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403742991001477120">live</a>): The price of green energy alternatives are going down. Solar is becoming cheaper than coal. But it’s not enough. Only option to fully replace fossil fuels is currently nuclear power.  I am hopeful that further research will eventually save us, as always.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612161452/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403741259857006597">12 June 2021</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403742420794281984">live</a>): There’s 7.7 billion of us, and fossil fuels are feeding us, connecting us, keeping us warm. And current strategies are pretty dumb. E.g Paris Agreement? A drop in the ocean. France rejecting Brazilian soy? The hypocrisy of a colonial power that has already deforested their lands.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612161452/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403741259857006597">12 June 2021</a>: Serious criticism is on how to tackle climate change, and not whether it is real. The article is a little shallow at the end.  The problem is that putting brakes on the economy leads to people starving, the main criticism for those that shame people for consuming…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610154831/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402997278281895936">10 June 2021</a>: The CoC does not represent a legal contract &amp; we aren’t in a court of law.  When people discuss whether “Nazis are OK” you can simply say “that’s not welcoming, we don’t do that here”, close the conversation &amp; that would be within CoC’s boundaries.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610120104/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402957925983866881">10 June 2021</a>: Yes, I wanted to emphasize the “effort” part. Adding a CoC is worthless w/o the effort to enforce it.  People doing it should go in with the right expectations, IMO, and for big FOSS communities (or companies) not everyone is capable. But still, it’s better than alternative IMO.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610120057/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402957020119146500">10 June 2021</a>: @milessabin  I voted for “necessary, but insufficient” actually 😅  I meant that CoCs are sufficient when enforced, and I wasn’t sure what those options meant. CoC can specify “be nice, don’t be an asshole, don’t be a bigot” &amp; that’s enough, but someone has to confront people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610110550/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402944747195486209">10 June 2021</a>: Which is totally needed, because truth be told, online communities die by pacifism.  Companies have to deal with this all the time, in private. One problem with open source is that everything is in public, for everyone to see and participate.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610110550/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402944747195486209">10 June 2021</a>: For moderators, too, we end up dealing w/ some cognitive dissonance.  B/c we end up censoring or banning people for how they think or how they act. Many of us are liberals, or conservatives, believing in free speech, which we have to balance against the freedom of association…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610110146/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402943664972865542">10 June 2021</a>: CoCs are necessary and sufficient. But slapping a CoC in a repository is worthless if not enforced.  Taking action against a perpetrator is really tough, as it creates conflict and drama, and you’ll always have a lot of critiques heading your way. Not for the faint-hearted.</li>

Society does evolve, the question is how. The left/right polarization doesn’t really help in understanding the landscape.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210607093935/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1401836075102920708"> 7 June 2021</a>: Centrism is a political position that accepts the compromise b/w social equality and the social hierarchy arising from freedom, and opposes (radical) reforms that would result in a significant shift of society (to the left or right) — also called “moderate” politics.</li>

Anything non-center is radical by definition, and the center is not ill-defined at all, in spite of society’s progress in time.</li>

It was my understanding that they have a more radical past, but that may be gone.  N.b by radical I don’t mean extremism, but rather non-center. Feminism in the past, now BLM, these are examples of radical movements.</li>

Far-right is on the rise across EU and is IMO the pendulum swinging back.</li>

We can work with most everything else, but not with those.  Negatives: communism, fascism, islamism.  Positives: liberalism, social democracy, Christian democracy.</li>

Democracy is a societal spirit, an equilibrium b/w opposing forces, but most important liberty vs equality.  This is why pluralism is vital in democracy, to keep that equilibrium. When pluralism is gone, so is democracy.</li>

None can work if Hamas stays in Gaza or Israel continues the World Bank occupation IMO.  But these are complicated issues. If it were simple, the conflict would’ve ended 70+ years ago.</li>

The apartheid state you’re talking of is the only democracy there.  I’m not blaming anyone, as the Middle East is in such a poor state due to hundreds of years of colonialism, but wishful thinking won’t solve the problem.</li>

Oppressing minorities was common in 19th-20th century, but those more oppressed were those w/o a country. E.g in interwar Romania that mean Jews and Roma, compared w/ Germans or Hungarians.  Happened all over Europe.</li>

Yes, it’s a militaristic state, probably b/c all it’s neighbors want to erase it off the map.  And you’re commenting from the security of an ongoing colonial empire.</li>

The browser is the ultimate sandbox.  But new browser features are leaky. E.g. WebRTC is awesome, but it can also leak your local IP address.

It’s mostly why communism went broke in Easter Europe. Individuals know their needs better, and it’s stupid even to think that you can plan a division of labor, which in capitalism is another unplanned phenomenon.

Doar că nu poți mânca tortul și să și-l păstrezi. Libertatea cuvântului este și libertatea de a nu asculta. Cu siguranță nu înseamnă toleranță din partea semenilor.

But we must acknowledge that biggest change in 20th century is people now have access to an abundance of cheap calories. That’s the primary change, nothing else explains the trend &amp; science confirms it.  And it’s probably not a “disease”, which makes it hard to “cure”.</li>

Some of us are wired to keep eating. Which isn’t bad if a famine is coming 😅</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210112120925/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1348965246527004675">12 January 2021</a>: Research is ongoing. Leptin seems to play a role.  This is a hormone emitted by the fat cells, for communicating fullness to the hypothalamus. The problem is  it works like a ping, but quantity stops mattering. Supplementation doesn’t work, the brain will just ignore it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210112110855/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1348950037238317056">12 January 2021</a>: 5/5   What we lack is an adaptation to deal with an overabundance of calories. The body does defend its weight (the body weight setpoint), even against overeating (e.g. increases body temperature and fidgeting), but it’s not doing a good job when weight is going up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210112110643/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1348949438748905472">12 January 2021</a>: 4/ The body adapts. It’s why people that lost weight can regain that weight much faster than the first time. Because when the overeating comes back, storage is prioritized, to prepare for winter.</li>

There’s an actual drug that prevents lipolysis. Insulin doesn’t, but this drug can.  Well, guess what, it doesn’t matter. Metabolism rate stays the same, and the people taking it don’t gain more weight. And drugs are tested in doubly-blind RCTs.</li>

We also tried pills for reducing the appetite, but appetite always comes back, as the body gains resistance to those pills.</li>

E.g we discovered leptin. Fat people have “leptin resistance”, that determines “body weight setpoint”, people feel the need to eat more, as brain is not getting satiety signals</li>

E.g Google has done great things, but it’s still an ads company, w/ the same incentive structure, and same potential for abuse, even if they behaved more responsibly. https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1345677279322636293</li>

Today it’s used to serve ads, tomorrow it may lower your credit score.  Data collection in itself is immoral, unless it’s done with an explicit purpose that the user knows about, and by law is only used for that purpose.</li>

But mobs can have an amplifying effect, and we can talk about reprisals, instead of just criticism, which can have a chilling effect on expression.

Mobs w/ pitchforks doing their own justice happens when the justice system becomes injust (and w/ systemic racism, it is injust almost by definition).

All cells pass knowledge when they replicate. And we evolved the means to bypass normal evolutionary mechanisms for transmitting  knowledge.  We are unique in nature, and we have to be careful about taking inspiration from animal models.</li>

We can simply teach our children to be nice, as a conscious decision, such that they don’t have to wait for the expression of genes.</li>

But because we can pass knowledge by language, aka culture, we can “evolve” without needing biological evolution, and we’ve done so quite successfully.</li>

So yes, we have a culture, we are passing notions of justice, of equality before the law to our children, that could be good for us, even if “unnatural”.</li>

Well, fuck yeah, humans had fire to predigest their food.  Similarly, we could pass knowledge via language.</li>

Denying white supremacy? Being anti-democracy?</li>

If not talking about hypotheticals, which of the presented facts are false? Note the defendant provides a detailed bibliography.

Censorship is censorship, even if in some instances it might be justified. On the topic at hand, IMO defamation laws protect the rich and powerful, not living up to expectations.

But such companies are founded in tech hubs and don’t need to scale the head count, being able to get by with 2-3 people that they can find locally.  I find it regrettable tbh.</li>

Of course I may be alone in opposing fascism/nazism and communism, as it seems liberalism is in short supply these days.   And before sweeping generalizations are made, as people apparently love to do that, I’m speaking solely in my name.</li>

While we can agree on the end (human rights, equality for all), we’ll always disagree on the means. I could never see eye to eye on the means to achieve equality w/ people believing in Marx/Lenin theories, as our views are fundamentally different.</li>

Although I’m sure Fabio was inspired by masking in Haskell.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: Indeed and I hope I didn’t let anything else come across.  I’m talking of  @Monix  due to its influence on cancelation.  Cats-Effect has been a great collaboration effort especially b/w developers of 2 competing libraries: fs2 and Monix (plus http4s, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: Cats-Effect is strongly inspired by Monix as I’m a major contributor to both:   https://github.com/monix/monix/graphs/contributors    https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/graphs/contributors   It is also inspired by fs2, due to involvement from  @djspiewak ,  @mpilquist  and others:   https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/graphs/contributors   These should be self-explanatory.</li>

  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052657/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252104906227713"> 7 September 2019</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170301525463306240">live</a>): Speaking of this idea, I was thinking that it is less generic… meaning that you have to seriously modify the implementation of an IO to support it and in a type class that might be a turn off, unless you make a type class that’s totally separate, to not restrict everything.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052657/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252104906227713"> 7 September 2019</a>: 👍 indeed, although that too originated in a discussion with SystemFw after my constant bickering that we still don’t have “continual”, a discussion in which John was involved and then he ran with it.  I’m not holding it against him and that you implemented it is good validation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922053132/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252125164711936"> 7 September 2019</a>: On the bifunctor IO, the problem is that it is very new, there isn’t much prior art b/c in Haskell people simply use EitherT. But we are certainly thinking about what to do there and you’re free to join us when we’ll discuss it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922053132/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252125164711936"> 7 September 2019</a>: This is not necessarily a general opinion, other people simply want monad transformers, but the ability to abstract over IO implementations is a core objective and that won’t change.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922053132/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252125164711936"> 7 September 2019</a>: Unfortunately the temperature has always been high, but that didn’t stop us from admiting mistakes or making compromises in opinions.  Here I’m describing how I believed “continual” is the better default, yet we flipped the default for maximizing compatibility…</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 16/16   And on a final note, we’re all standing on the shoulders of giants. Most of the work that we do is inspired by Haskell’s IO. There’s also the issue that math is discovered not invented.  This is why I’m always wary of taking credit for anything I do, so I don’t.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 15/ Cats-Effect was built for interoperability from the get-go and it remained true to that mission from its inception until today.  And yes, we are working on its next major version. Stay tuned.</li>

  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 13/ The reason for why I think “start” is bad is that:  1. it is rarely needed, people can just work with parMapN or race  2. it is error prone and must almost always be used in the context of a “bracket”  In other words it is too low level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 12/ And I don’t even want to claim credit for this one, because it’s super obvious and I might have seen it somewhere else.  There’s also “start”, Fiber’s side-kick. I kind of regret introducing “start” and advise people to not use it. That one comes from fs2 and Haskell first.</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 11/ Note however that before doing this,  @Monix  already had its own, less pure type for expressing a “Fiber” called “CancelableFuture”.  I refer you still to 3.0.0-M1 and here’s the signature for which John later claimed credit as well:   https://github.com/monix/monix/blob/v3.0.0-M1/monix-eval/shared/src/main/scala/monix/eval/Task.scala#L1308  pic.twitter.com/kTxKu0uLMJ</li>

Anyway, back to Fibers, the idea is pretty simple and this is indeed where we took inspiration from ZIO: pic.twitter.com/hwGEQRcBlA</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 9/ Don’t get me wrong, this design choice is also making code safer. This is a general gotcha in Haskell, you have to mask “acquire” and “release” by yourself.  It’s a good default, but not without an escape hatch, or it invalidates a super common pattern: https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/pull/424</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 8/ Unfortunately we did import a design decision from ZIO and that is to make “acquire” and “release” uncancelable — something which Haskell doesn’t do.  This makes the type class unfortunately less generic… https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/382</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 7/ So we added Bracket, b/c we are also Haskell developers and this was a no-brainer.  Can you see any ZIO btw in sight? This isn’t to say that we weren’t aware of ZIO implementing it, or that we didn’t make changes related to ZIO. We did. https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/88</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 6/ Bracket comes from Haskell and if you can have threads that can be killed asynchronously by anything and that can’t be observed when they get killed, then you desperately need it — but one can argue that copying Haskell’s model isn’t necessarily OK:   https://wiki.haskell.org/Bracket_pattern</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 5/ Then I reluctantly made Cats-Effect’s IO itself auto-cancelable, b/c its purpose is to be a reference implementation and we did not want people to build generic code assuming the behavior of a reference implementation, but that breaks w/  @Monix  or ZIO: https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/pull/311</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 4/ But because of  @Monix  and of ZIO, we restated the laws to allow for auto-cancellation, depending on implementation: https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/pull/237</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 3/ You can see for example how it makes it possible to “observe” cancelation via “onCancelRaiseError”, transforming cancellation in just another exception you can recover from, which in the auto-cancelation model is no longer possible: pic.twitter.com/HEnlrOsBz6</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052600/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252075873255424"> 7 September 2019</a>: 2/ Difference from today is the default was the “continual” model, in which flatMap chains were not cancelable by default, only individual “nodes” in the chain, making the model much more reasonable.  First version of cancelable IO was “continual”: https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/242</li>

We have huge problems with mass media in Romania too. But it’s missing the forest from the trees and this left narrative naturally invites censorship and speaking as a child of communism, censorship is not going to be in your favor.</li>

European countries do not have the diversity of the US and its experience with integrating immigrants. And when you don’t listen to society’s fears, Trump, Brexit and Le Pen happen.</li>

  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180309101649/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/972053571125604353"> 9 March 2018</a>: I should mention that Român comes from the Latin word “Romanus” (Roman) and it’s been in use for at least a thousand years, in Walachia. I empathize <em>a lot</em> and agree w/ wanting to get rid of pejorative words, but Romani is a terrible name to pick for an unrelated ethnic group.</li>

But the situation is complicated and the media reports of discrimination here are overblown. Yes, there are cases, but overall it’s pretty good to be a minority in Romania 😉</li>

Romanians in our language is spelled “români”, so making Romanians accept “Romani” is a showstopper. And we do have a sizable Roma community, for which we’ve been discriminated in the EU. I believe the UK used this in their Brexit campaign…</li>

Attacking people negates dialog and education opportunities, it’s why that quoted tweet offended me.</li>
