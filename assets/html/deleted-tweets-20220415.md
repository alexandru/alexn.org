* [28 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328115711/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508412109994045444): Google has been competent, but they shouldn‚Äôt collect & attach that history to profiles in the first place, while convincing people to keep their history on via dark patterns.  E.g., doing health-related searches on Google can jeopardize medical insurance or endanger minorities.
* [28 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328114642/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508410114721697793): I wouldn‚Äôt attend a conference in which people make fun of other people‚Äôs illnesses or where violence, for whatever reason, is tolerated.
* [28 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328113719/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407642032680970): Google is no longer my default search engine b/c I don‚Äôt trust them. It‚Äôs not good when a service you rely on can be your adversary. I still use it as a fallback, especially for programming-related or local searches.  Reasonable alternatives are DuckDuckGo or Brave Search.
* [28 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328113719/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407642032680970) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508407640304631810)): Google is the best search engine by far, but on each search I have to think about the implications beforehand, given what Google may learn about me.  What weaknesses will expose me to financial loses or manipulation? What may constitute wrongthink in the future?
* [27 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220327101639/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025075185991681): There is a lot to criticize about cryptocurrency and its unregulated nature, which has fueled scams and which might trigger another financial crisis.  Even so, cryptocurrency is here to stay, long term, as it‚Äôs becoming a reaction to statism.
* [27 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220327101639/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025075185991681) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1508025073554399232)): One point of contention I have with crypto-skepticism is the idea that cryptocurrency is only useful for funding ‚Äúcrime‚Äù.  Whether you agree with the weaponization of the financial system or not, cryptocurrency is legitimized for funding ‚Äúdissent‚Äù and dissent isn‚Äôt crime.
* [27 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220327002135/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875317150584839): I‚Äôll never understand the anti-intellectualism among devs.  For one, it closes your mind to new things. And even if you believe that a certain tool or paradigm or practice isn‚Äôt the best thing since GC, you can still be respectful, even mindful of other people & their work.
* [27 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220327002135/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875317150584839) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507875315502170113)): Almost all improvements in CS are incremental, but add up. E.g. Future/Promise was a marginal improvement over callbacks, yet by now most people avoid callbacks.  It‚Äôs fine to show enthusiasm for marginal improvements. We‚Äôre builders, taking pride in our craftsmanship.
* [26 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220326081701/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507632409461891077): I‚Äôm not fond of Romania‚Äôs Christianity, BTW. People practice a lot of traditions and customs (churchisms), but there‚Äôs less learned Christian ethics. I guess that serves a purpose too, but I sense a potential for toxic nationalism during crises.
* [26 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220326081033/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507630615558070275): Religion is in human nature. Atheism, at least the non-agnostic kind, is a religion too, defined in terms of Christianity, often focusing on man‚Äôs own ability to evolve (another religion) ‚Äî found this book by John Gray on ‚Äú7 types of atheism‚Äù interesting: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36482672-seven-types-of-atheism
* [25 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567): What separates liberal democracies from dictatorships? Why aren‚Äôt all countries devolving?  Is it wealth, education, rule of law? What systemic processes helped democracies in achieving these, and aren‚Äôt we destroying them by converging on authoritarianism?  End üßµ
* [25 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567): It‚Äôs easy to just ban disent, no trial necessity. Out of sight, out of mind, burn those books, problem solved /s
* [25 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567): We‚Äôre losing the information war, and the way governments, activists, or Big Tech choose to fight is censorship, which is iliberal and always has unintended consequences.  We‚Äôre using the tools of dictators, of losers, but that authoritarian siren is strong.
* [25 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325072614/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1507257448956055567): Phrases for spotting most conspiracy theories in 21st century:  - ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been lied to‚Äù - ‚ÄúCorporate interests‚Äù  This describes, for example: - every fad diet; - anti-vaxxing; - putinism; - flat earth; - QAnon; - most recent Russell Brand videos;
* [24 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220324130001/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506978845450293256): My opinion is that they fear a direct NATO intervention (e.g. closing the sky) so they are threatening with the escalation everyone fears. However I was also of the opinion that Russia won‚Äôt invade Ukraine, as it would be a pretty dumb and irrational move, and yet they proceeded.
* [24 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220324054159/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506868801215901697): Hearing flanger or phaser sound effects applied on a singer‚Äôs voice is unappealing, as I ended up associating such effects with not having a good singing voice ü§î
* [23 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323191737/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506711592154578945): Carbohydrate-insulin model is dishonest quackery.  If you want to get lean by reliving a glorious past, go back to 19th century and work the land to exhaustion, feeling hungry most of the time. Living in USSR or during WW2 works too. Also give up meat & fat, it was too expensive.
* [23 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323191737/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506711592154578945): ‚ÄúThe Big Fat Surprise‚Äù is a book describing a conspiracy theory of why people got fat. And it‚Äôs absolute bullshit.  This quackery has been believed, even promoted by well known programmers. We aren‚Äôt immune to BS; not much of a difference compared to anti-vaxing or homeopathy. https://twitter.com/MrSollozzo/status/1506239292175118336
* [23 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323155651/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506661103706812422): In  #Akka  Streams, is there a way to make those streams log something whenever buffers are full and it goes into back-pressure?  Asking a friend üôÇ
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221702/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506394402612260872): And I admit my view may be naive, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say ‚Äúequality good, inequality bad,‚Äù as it‚Äôs a complex problem.  I love the equality in Nordic European countries, BTW. But we can‚Äôt ignore the geopolitical reasons behind their wealth, not easy to reproduce.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221310/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506393410822975489): I mean, I may be mad at China‚Äôs human rights violations, but I can‚Äôt be anything but happy to see their middle-class growing (due to unscrupulous businessmen, no less). Ditto for Vietnam, India, etc.  We need to pull all people out of poverty in order to tackle world problems.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322221041/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506392721170350083): US citizens will rightly point out that the standard of living and wages in the US are stagnating since 20th century. Such numbers are misleading due to population growth, but even if true ‚Ä¶ there is also wealth redistribution to poorer countries due to outsourcing‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220738/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506392091227787278): This idea that wealth should be measured by standards of living, instead of stashed money, isn‚Äôt new. Adam Smith was a proponent.  Rich people get richer due to re-invenvesting their wealth (just like the state), which creates further innovation and even jobs (with caveats)‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220521/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506391511017078795): When Marx noticed the poor working conditions of the proletariat in factories, he was right, except he didn‚Äôt take into account the population explosion, as people were no longer starving to death.  Does it matter if we have inequality, given people‚Äôs lives are much better?‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322220254/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506390905502187529): It depends on perspective.  In feudalism/slavery, for people to get rich, they had to take from the poor as the pie was constant.  The industrial revolution changed the paradigm due to innovation, which is growing the pie‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322212229/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506380703612735496): I think public education and public healthcare are a must, BTW.  And social democracy isn‚Äôt communism.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322212101/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506380333813489665): Education, BTW, is never a right but a privilege. It‚Äôs awesome to have public education, but it consumes resources, and to receive public education, this means someone else is forced to provide it. So, it only works as long as people can pay for it. Usually, the West can manage.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211857/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506379723089367041): Individualism means the rights of  individuals. These are rights humans are born with, that the state should protect.  Like being free (instead of being slave) or ability to speak up (w/o being deported), or ability to move, or to practice whatever trade you want‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211421/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506378649796231170): I should also add:  3. Rule of law;  People say that USSR failed b/c it evolved from feudalism, so it was corrupted. I think you can‚Äôt have a rule of law w/o individualism, which means freedom of speech or private property that are antithetical to ‚Äúultimate‚Äù social orders.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322211030/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506377707491373062): The distinguishing features of political ideologies that we can live with should be..  1. Individualism; 2. Pluralism;  Democracy is basically a struggle b/w the left pushing for equality and the right pushing for freedom, the 2 goals being opposite, democracy providing balance.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322210512/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506376374449319940): The spectrum from social democracy to whatever you understand by neoliberalism is all good for now, as long as we have liberal democracy and market economy (as opposed to the command economy).  I‚Äôll refrain from predicting an ultimate social order, as only radicals do that‚Ä¶
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322192332/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506350742894002186): I should stop now ‚Äì end üßµüôÇ
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322191634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506349060080476170): In former comunist Romania too, although we didn‚Äôt kill our bourgeoisie, we just imprisoned them in labor camps or deported them, forever labeling their families as pariah (e.g. their children unable to attend school), where bourgeoisie included peasants w/ a piece of land.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322191634/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506349060080476170): For completeness, I was informed that Marx‚Äôs quote may be an inaccurate combination of Marx+Engels.  Bad source. I am familiar w/ his work, esp the class-strugle view of history, which was turned by Lenin up a notch, responsible for literal class war. https://otaviopinto.com/index.php/2016/08/04/did-marx-write-this/
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322185500/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506343646341304329): It happened in comunist Romania too BTW, although we didn‚Äôt kill our bourgeoisie, we just deported them or imprisoned them in re-education camps, forever labeling them and their families as pariah (where bourgeoisie soon became all peasants that had a piece of land).
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322185300/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506343027027107848): I was informed that the quote by Marx may be an inaccurate combination of Marx and Engels.  The class struggle theory is Marx‚Äôs creation, though, which  Lenin turned up a notch, as overthrowing the old world order couldn‚Äôt come soon enough. https://otaviopinto.com/index.php/2016/08/04/did-marx-write-this/
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714): Communism is poison.  Russia may no longer be communist, but it‚Äôs still haunted by the ghost of communism.  Also, the big communist country that still stands is performing genocides of its own, as we speak, while we keep doing business as usual.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714): Karl Marx was basically a theorist of political genocide, one of the first, and you‚Äôve got European and US leaders still celebrating him and his legacy.  When people promote Marx‚Äôs theories, they are promoting an ideology that killed tens of millions of innocents.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714): At the heart of communism is the class struggle, and communism, just like fascism, is fixated on creating a ‚Äúnew man‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe classes and the races too weak to master the new conditions of life must give way.‚Äù They must ‚Äúperish in the revolutionary holocaust‚Äù ‚Äî Karl Marx
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714): Nazism was based on false biology, while communism was based on false sociology, both ‚Äúscientific‚Äù.  It‚Äôs why USSR is being discredited as ‚Äúnot a true communism‚Äù, all such attempts boiling down to a ‚Äúno true Scotsman‚Äù fallacy, but it‚Äôs just the difference b/w dreams and reality.
* [22 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322171707/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1506318895011016714): Communism killed more people than Nazism, Stalin killed more people than Hitler, even the Holocaust was preceded by Holodomor (in which 10 million Ukrainians were killed by famine).  Only one of these monsters / ideologies / countries were universally condemned. üßµ
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321134402/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505902833010364419): It happened in Romania too üòî i.e. ex-communists that were part of the oppression apparatus to become leaders after the revolution.  If it weren‚Äôt for the EU integration, we‚Äôd be screwed.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): I wish for Russia to become a democratic member of the EU and for us to prosper together in peace.  But for that to happen, its post-WW2 identity must be crushed, and communism must be condemned; otherwise, we‚Äôll never have peace, imperialist Russia behaving like a tidal wave.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Putin is an ex-KGB that was trained to hate everything about the West. Can you imagine a former Gestapo or Stasi agent becoming chancellor of Germany after WW2? You can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not possible.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): I‚Äôll also add that Putin is possible because we never condemned comunism, we never demanded an apology from Russia.  Germany, Japan, they apologized for WW2; they condemned their mistakes, and we‚Äôve moved on. But not Russia.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Soviet Russia also squashed dissent inside the Iron Curtain by invading with their army. Like when they invaded Czechoslovakia for becoming too liberal, or Hungary for revolting.  USSR or the Iron Curtain fell because revolts happened without the Russian army showing up!
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Romanians were no angels in WW2, we participated in the Holocaust and in operation Barbarossa.  Our ‚Äúliberators,‚Äù however, plundered, murdered and raped, then exploited our resources for years, something which happened throughout Eastern Europe.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Romania has a long history w/ imperialist Russia. They ‚Äúliberated‚Äù us since the Ruso-Turkish wars, yet they behaved like an occupational army, plundering, murdering peasants, raping women.  Romania happened w/ sponsorship of France/UK as a buffer, b/c Romanians hated Russians.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Molotov-Ribbentrop is no singular event of Soviet-Nazi cooperation. In fact, the nazi army was rebuilt between 1922 ‚Äì 1933 at secret bases in USSR.   Stalin and other soviet leaders wanted to destabilize Europe. Stalin‚Äôs Russia had no issue w/ nazism until they were invaded.
* [21 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220321132140/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1505897309866975234): Russia has forgotten the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which quite literally divided Poland b/w Germany and Russia. We, the Romanians, know it as that‚Äôs how Stalin occupied Bessarabia too (current Moldova).  Their whole post-WW2 national identity, that of nazi liberators, is a lie. üßµ https://twitter.com/maxfras/status/1505845102811533313

Milenials got out of communism w/o financial ed, they work on the black market, they don‚Äôt save and I‚Äôm foreseeing a lot of homelessness.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317163008/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504495234457247750): Not sure about other places, but I wouldn‚Äôt get more money with contracting, versus regular employment.  A lot of taxes are paid on my salary, around 42%, however 25% is for the public social security system. And if I‚Äôd contract, for earning more I‚Äôd end up paying VAT 19%.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317162912/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504494908559826948): > b2b doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean being a contractor  But it does, as that‚Äôs what your contract says. Everything else is handshake trust, which tends to not be much, as the company you‚Äôre working for is not your family.  Nvm that most people are not saving in a retirement fund‚Ä¶
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317140906/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504426236436692992): I don‚Äôt disagree üò¢ War needs goals too though (something which US lacked in Afghanistan for example). I sometimes think a direct confrontation with NATO to push the Russian army back would have been better, but I may be talking nonsense.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317114822/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504421016075911172): Two things conspire against revolt:  1. Russia is controlled by a secret police that now terrorizes the population; 2. Strict control of information using modern tools / massive censorship;  Most westerners have never lived under such conditions, or their parents.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317112954/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504419303893909505): I both agree and disagree.  You can be a shareholder only in a democratic country.  I think Russians have shared responsibility for what happened, but that will only matter as a learning lesson, as changing the course of this war is still out of their control.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317131212/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504402184921882629): I think you should reconsidered.  Citizenship doesn‚Äôt matter, as it‚Äôs not necessarily a personal choice, and citizens may or may not be able to revolt. Targeting citizenship with sanctions is dehumanizing, and with no clear goal of defunding the war machine, it doesn‚Äôt even work.
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317102624/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1504401394354343938): And for example, do you know what the world will do after seeing that national currencies or banking systems are weaponized?  The world will start switching to alternatives. These sanctions, as needed as they are to stop the war, just legitimized cryptocoins‚Ä¶

Also, in any company contractors are the first to go during a crisis, due to no having employment protections.

It only radicalizes the population against a common enemy. It took Eastern Europeans decades to get rid of stalinism.

Economic sanctions will make life harder for Russians, it‚Äôs undeniable. But the war machine won‚Äôt be affected by canceling Dostoevsky or by foreign companies refusing to do business w/ Russians.

While bombs are dropping & I‚Äôm wishing for Russia‚Äôs war machine to be destroyed, there will have to be a reckoning for how unjust some of the canceling has been.

In spite of Russian military incompetence, they have the capacity for broad front war that will spill in the Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary,  Slovakia, etc. In essence, WW3.

Also, the energy crises has given rise to extreme-right parties all across Europe, an energy crisis partially created by not having enough wind last year.

IMO a regime cannot last for long without strong popular support, even in a police state with a rigged system. Dictators are kept in power by the majority, which may be kept ignorant on purpose.

And yes, they‚Äôve committed 50% of their forces, they couldn‚Äôt even gain air superiority, they are out of guided missiles, they‚Äôll run out of resources in 2 weeks, and they‚Äôve already called on Belarus reservists and cecens for help.

It‚Äôs about meeting force with force. If Russia‚Äôs dictator is able to release nukes while his army fights in a territory outside of Russia, then he‚Äôs dangerous enough to release them at any moment for any reason.

And it doesn‚Äôt matter if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúwork.‚Äù EU should stop subsidizing the war machines of dictators as it makes us complicit & prone to blackmailing.

Responsibility towards customers is profit-driven, for individuals too. What makes you think that unionizing will make products better, instead of worse? Has it ever worked?

What I know is what happened in Romania before and after 1990 (the fell of communism). You can‚Äôt fix starvation with handouts IMO. What a country needs is an economy first, and education is in support of that.

Not sure how it is elsewhere, but in the poor rural parts of Romania, people would like better jobs & infrastructure, not food handouts.

To deny access to resources for some groups, in the hope that other groups will be able to compete for those resources. It‚Äôs what happened in practice w/ 20th century‚Äôs communism.

You provide the tools, the infrastructure for YouTube creators to be successful, regardless of background, and let them create. But this will yield inequality of outcome, based on individual merits alone. You will not get equity.

I think money muddies the water, as not all wealth earned is based on merit. However think popularity.   A YouTube creator that‚Äôs successful will earn influence. How can you create equity in this space? Distribute views & likes?

By equity I understand equality of outcome, which may actually be at odds with equality of opportunity. Nothing wrong w/ dreaming of a better world, but seems to me that dreams of equity is how we got the horrors of communism from 20th century.

You‚Äôre anti-something or anti-someone, so you pick their opposition as your allies. The mentality is: ‚Äúenemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù.  Historically this led to pretty bad outcomes. Reject it.

It‚Äôs obvious, and doable, without creating mountains of e-waste from toy cars with which you barely drive for 300 Km without worrying about finding a charging station that isn‚Äôt occupied & actually works.

Want cleaner cities and less pollution? Switch to public transport. Also, hipsters using regular bikes are cooler.

I will not buy an electric car unless a revolution happens in batteries.

Europe‚Äôs plan to enforce the selling of electric cars by 2035 is downright stupid.  Li-ion batteries are expensive, have poor range, are hard to charge, and really hard to recycle.

What about population control?  There is a limit, yes. But besides innovation & taxing externalities, doing nothing else might be the right thing to do. Versus deciding who lives.

My problem w/ the argument is that the cause isn‚Äôt capitalism, or greed. We also have to acknowledge that west‚Äôs middle-class may want survival at expense of people starving. Similar to pandemic lockdowns.

Saying that capitalism is depends on economic growth is like saying that good health depends on endless loss of weight.  In truth many times economists are clueless about how it all works.

It also comes from innovation (producing more with less resources). Goes without saying that we need innovation more than ever.

Of course, but those products now get assembled in places like China, India, Vietnam. It‚Äôs basically wealth redistribution that works.  Pulling the world out of poverty means more economic growth, not less.

* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729174435/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420781306644992007): Right. But that‚Äôs basically the argument of authoritarianism. People are a danger to others and themselves, so they need to be told what to do by wiser men.

* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729173738/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420782018472857608): ‚Ä¶ also incompetence of governments (Trump, Boris Johnson, etc). If there‚Äôs unhealthy skepticism right now, that‚Äôs basically a reaction to what happened last year.
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729170406/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420777691683430401): Social responsibility can be exercised w/o state coercion. We are socially responsible every time we leave home, and it‚Äôs not just b/c of penal code.  That people aren‚Äôt socially responsible right now, that‚Äôs IMO b/c of mistakes from 2020 (fear porn + early lockdowns).
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729165124/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420776458981625859): Personal choices are most often choices with social impact. That‚Äôs what happens when people vote. Due to its scale, how do we know that it‚Äôs not the vaccines themselves that are driving the dangerous mutations?Democratic processes are even more relevant in though times.
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729170406/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420777691683430401): I was the first in line to get vaccinated BTW, w/ AstraZeneca even if I could get Pfizer. I also had fights within my own family.  But I‚Äôd rather live in a world in which people are free to be fools, instead of in authoritarianism, and liberal values are seriously stress-tested.
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729165124/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420776458981625859): Much like how in 2020 the attempts to ‚Äúsuppress‚Äù the virus via lockdown in March-April (instead of January) were futile, we don‚Äôt really know what to do, and we are probably too late in doing anything. Except for protecting people that want to be protected.
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729165124/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420776458981625859): At this point, the virus may keep mutating anyway, like flu. Due to global scale, it‚Äôs inevitable. Simplistic narratives like ‚Äúif virus cannot spread, it cannot mutate‚Äù are too simplistic. Tell that to India, w/ its 1.4 billion people, which is where Delta comes from‚Ä¶

* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729131031/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420732935582457858): As long as individuals can protect themselves (vaccination, masks, WFH), I don‚Äôt see a problem in people being free to act stupid.  Authoritarianism has always been more efficient at mobilizing resources in a crisis, freedom is personal responsibility & skepticism is democratic.
* [29 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802160753/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1422223855419076612) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1420694665628631044)): Facebook, Twitter, YouTube have a role in ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù, but that‚Äôs due to their algorithms incentivizing outrage. The problem isn‚Äôt an arbitration of truth, or lack thereof.  Calls for censorship on these platforms are shortsighted & will backfire.

It‚Äôs just a decent conductor.  Social constructs are results of human interactions. That independent reinventing happens, that‚Äôs b/c we think alike & get exposed to similar environments.
* [24 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724213908/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418999407706624004): We agree that all are social constructs.  Missing ingredient for lasting value is tradition. E.g CCs won‚Äôt replace gold soon, as gold has been used for millennia. Regulations are valuable too, even if they impede innovation.  Will be interesting to see how it pans out.
* [24 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724213908/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418999407706624004): In absence of institutions, the same that imbue fiat money with value, there is no such thing as intrinsic value. It‚Äôs all a social construct.   This is the reason for why capitalism w/o rule of law has never worked.
* [24 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724182402/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418994422126157825): Land has zero value if you can‚Äôt defend it, or you can‚Äôt do subsistence farming on it.  Food, yes, but a food supply chain is a social construct that disappears as soon as fiat money becomes ‚Äújust paper.
* [24 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724182402/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418994422126157825) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418994715333177344)): I feel like the ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù arguments are almost religious. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre talking of the existence of the soul or of free will.
* [24 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724182402/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1418994422126157825): Fiat money and stocks do have ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù.  In a world in which fiat money becomes ‚Äújust paper‚Äù, the constant supply of food & goods (we associate w/ ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù) stops flowing. And given institutional collapse, everything loses value, including land.

I do believe in pluralism though, and will leave with this thought ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs never a winning move to blame people of greed. Democracy is compromise, and that makes compromise hard.
* [17 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717204820/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1416500010577977344): Out of 1000 music artists, only about 10 will be well known, w/ appreciated pieces.  The socialist solution is to distribute the views & likes. The capitalist solution is to specialize people to be good at something else & contribute, specialization which Marx critiqued.
* [17 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717203348/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1416496262757720071): The problem isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúgiving a damn‚Äù part, but rather that we disagree on the means and the critiques, which sometimes come straight out of marxism.  You say it‚Äôs the greed & cruelty, when in fact most care as much and there‚Äôs a conflict of visions.  I‚Äôll shut up üôÇ

Inflation is a direct consequence. Maybe less in powerful economies. But this ain‚Äôt capitalism.

Hunger and poverty are at an all time low.  I will grant you that some people are so poor that they have no chance to grow, and we need to help them.  I‚Äôm for ‚Äúuniversal basic income‚Äù, public healthcare/ education.

That doesn‚Äôt mean business owners don‚Äôt try bending the rules of free market. Adam Smith for example was for regulation to keep market free.  Profitability is a signal. Like all signals, some people over-optimize for short-term gains.

Covid-19 driven remote work;  2. Tensions b/w US and Russia or others; ransomware coming from Eastern Europe‚Ä¶ and if it‚Äôs funded or tolerated by state agencies, then the ransom could be just an excuse.

Some critiques of capitalism are warranted.  For us the bogeyman was real, we unfortunately shot  them on Christmas ‚Äò89 (I was a child when communism fell) & fear their ghost.

Communism is bad b/c it‚Äôs based on a flawed theory of why capitalism is bad, while hoping for the same progress that capitalism brings, which never happens, as it totally misses the point. https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1411674809570844681

Freedom of speech, interestingly, in the US was a virtue of the left (e.g in the 60s). It can‚Äôt be claimed by either side. And nowadays reactionaries complain about loss of free speech, while doing everything they can to ban LGBT+ ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù by law.

This isn‚Äôt incompatible w/ justice, ofc.  Mass-media, the ‚Äúcourt of public opinion‚Äù, can do a good job to show us when the justice system isn‚Äôt working. Like in the case of sexual assaults.

You need international cooperation for solving such cases and I don‚Äôt see how CCs make this harder.

Let me help w/ reading comprehension‚Ä¶  If cryptocoins make some crime easier, allegedly, so what? Plenty of instruments enable crime in society.  Make a reasonable argument for why we should care this time.

Cryptocoins may be used for paying for crime, online, which may make it preferable to cash in some scenarios (e.g ransomware).  So what‚Äôs the problem?
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716113444/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1415998136821198854): For Ethereum apps ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know of cool uses right now, some people say it can revolutionize administration.

E.g. Brave‚Äôs approach to ‚Äúreward‚Äù users for watching ads, letting them ‚Äútip‚Äù publishers, is at least interesting.

For instant transfers of money b/w countries, you end up working w/ solutions like Revolut, but that‚Äôs centralized (lock-in).  Instant transfers b/w banks have yet to materialize.

Currently, microtransactions aren‚Äôt feasible due to high cost, the Visa/Mastercard monopoly being involved. Granted, some of that cost is justified by fraud detection.

But cash enables crime too, cash being on its way out. Do we really want all transactions tracked by the state?  And not all crime is immoral. One case is SciHub being banned by PayPal, now accepting Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as ‚Äúwild west capitalism‚Äù, adding adjectives to the noun isn‚Äôt valid.

But banning concrete causes for CO2 emissions is stupid & will not solve climate issues. The right solution is to incentivise the market to optimize for low CO2 emissions.

We have a higher death rate unfortunately, but higher poverty is still a risk for this country, and poverty kills too, albeit indirectly, being hard to measure.

Conspiracies, burned budget, that‚Äôs the result of lockdowns promoted by the privileged.

We also closed schools too early.

This ‚Äúyou‚Äôre either with me or against me‚Äù attitude is polarizing and anti-democratic.

Democracy is a marketplace for your electoral vote. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it does a really good job to keep a balance b/w equality & freedom, and to isolate extremism by vote.

And state interventions in economy have arguably done more harm than good, prolonging economic crises, creating more inequality.

You can‚Äôt have capitalism w/o a free market, entrepreneurial education, and the rule of law.

A free market economy is one that‚Äôs always seeking equilibrium, but never reaching it, due to innovation giving birth to competition. And the invisible hand tying it all is self-interest.

It can (e.g the Internet), but that often happens in concert w/ private entities. It can‚Äôt be relied on, as we‚Äôve seen in former USSR & satellites. In communist Romania consumerism felt like progress & freedom.

If you aren‚Äôt a startup founder or executive at a big co, why aren‚Äôt you?  Be honest here ‚Äî you hate the associated risk, and our salaries are high enough for us to not want to risk our well-being.

The working class only risks their salary, whereas the entrepreneur often risks their entire fortune.

Obviously value-added (profit) is not an exploitation factor. The device I use to write this message is a direct refutation of Marx‚Äôs theory.

E.g we have a CO2 problem b/c it‚Äôs an externality, a subsidy.

Some ideologies appeal to altruism for achieving our potential, while others recognize that we are imperfect beings and work within those constraints.  Some default to equality, others to liberty.

People know their self-interest and should be allowed to affiliate to ideas that serve them, but such affiliations are subjective. Which is why we call them ideologies, not sciences.

It‚Äôs important to realize that ideologies are abstractions, theories built on first principles that distort the real world, and the details ignored may be important. Which is why it is easy to make mistakes.

He was not an economist in any traditional sense, his predictions and theories coming from flawed inference from history.  For example he totally missed an analysis of capitalism being the free market economy.

However he was hoping for the same creatively destructive force to be embodied in communism. And he seemed to be clueless about why capitalism works.

He was a primitivist. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism

Eventually those oppressed and exploited will realize that they have the power, and will rise. Via revolution, which communists took very seriously.

According to him historical ages are characterized by their economic system: primitive community, slavery, feudalism, and now capitalism, which will end by necessity, according to him.

Difference b/w production cost and selling price, aka profit, for him is the exploitation factor.

In his vision,  and that of many socialists, economy is a zero-sum game ‚Äî in order for someone to win, somebody else has to lose. https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1410203155720253441

For example, you can‚Äôt change that license. Which is why projects doing copy/pasting from BSD/MIT projects have to retain the copyright notice and license for the copied code.

Marxists are obsessed w/ forging a ‚Äúnew man‚Äù, much like fascists, but w/ a slightly different story to tell.

They also say the horrors we‚Äôve seen in communism mustn‚Äôt be due to Marxism, as communism wasn‚Äôt implemented according to Marx‚Äôs ideals. Which is factually untrue, all major elements being there.

Now neo-marxists are coming up w/ all sorts of wild theories for why that is, like people being corrupted by consumerism (aka progress), coupled w/ socialists being crushed in a global conspiracy.

In communism, for sure, because shared hatred for the rich, the privileged, the competent is stronger than any solidarity Marx could envision.

Beyond the law, beyond capital or knowledge, your own body, thoughts, feelings are also private property. A hallmark of extremism is the idea that people need to be dictated what to do with their own body, what to think, how to live.

Abolishing private property strikes at the heart of humanity. Without private property, all other civil liberties will fall, as there can be no freedom or dignity without it.

But the biggest elephant in the room is that the population is growing, which is what is actually driving the economic growth (and other implications, such as global warming).

Specialization is a form of capital, as people learn a trade, allowing them to fulfil their private interests. And you couldn‚Äôt feed billions of people w/o this efficiency.

In communism, people are supposed to work for work‚Äôs sake. Adam Smith on the other hand rightly points out that the baker doesn‚Äôt serve you out of the goodness of his heart, but due to a private interest.

Given Marx‚Äôs entire philosophy is around the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat, this puts it in serious doubt.

Guy is saying that Marxism hasn‚Äôt failed b/c it doesn‚Äôt propose a solution, being a critique of capitalism that‚Äôs still valid.  Alarms went off. I‚Äôm like, buddy, it‚Äôs precisely Marx‚Äôs critique of capitalism that‚Äôs deeply flawed.

Life is chaotic. Such theories are born b/c we feel we‚Äôll regain control if we‚Äôll expose the puppeteers.

Not necessarily hate. Not all of them are nazis, the problem is people pick up wrong ideas about normality and biology or science, then repeat them.

Problem w/ forums like Facebook is that a lot of moderates on the fence are watching. I don‚Äôt care about those spewing hate, but about their audience, which is why I get this burning desire to intervene, so hoping for sustainability.

But reminding people that we‚Äôre talking about humans with hopes and dreams is a good strategy. A problem is when we talk freaking metaphysics, in the abstract.

Until 2001 gay people could go to jail.  There‚Äôs a lot of ignorance, people feel their identity threatened, they fear western ‚Äúdepravity‚Äù, they have ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù ‚Ä¶

People that are calmly pushing back against bigotry with reason, humility and keep their patience and kindness are my heroes.  Personally I can‚Äôt.

But there are multiple flavors and due to right-wing parties converging we now have populists catering to the ultraorthodox and obsessing about what people do w/ their own bodies‚Ä¶

Whereas the far-right is on the rise all over Europe. Kind of hard to worry about leftist cultural revolution when we‚Äôve got actual fascists in our Parliament.

In Romania conservatives are fighting tooth and nail to prevent sexual education in schools, to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù children from gender identity.
* [25 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625053808/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408298380028223488): I‚Äôm a liberal conservative üëã  France is a very socialist country. Look instead at Poland, Hungary, or the UK even. Also some parties are supposedly social democrat but have ultraconservative social policies, e.g PSD in Romania.  80%+ of hate crimes, of terorism, is right wing.

We all have that potential for bigotry. Recognizing it and its nature is important IMO for combating it.  It‚Äôs such a good word. Too bad we don‚Äôt really have it in Romanian.

It can also be very confusing for people, as many bigoted statements do not in fact signal hatred, being merely ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù.
* [24 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624105526/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408015854462193664): As a centrist, I worry about the left‚Äôs cultural revolution and cancel culture, but let‚Äôs get one thing straight ‚Ä¶ the ongoing problem of last decade has been the far-right.  Most hate crimes, or fake news, or new legislation impeding freedoms is right-wing (aka conservative).
* [24 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624103040/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1408009644811898881): Bigotry isn‚Äôt hatred, even if correlated. Bigotry is prejudice against a group of people.  Bigotry isn‚Äôt an offense, but a political stance, triggering reactionism against the rights of those groups. It‚Äôs a stance against equality, against treating all people as human beings.
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617065547/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405418853081960449): You have to consider that medical research in such instances is difficult, since we can‚Äôt purposefully infect people w/ Sars-Cov-2 in a controlled setting, as that would be immoral. And there are many safety checks in place, ensuring proposed treatments are effective & safe.

And that‚Äôs actually an argument used by anti-vaxxers, as if steps were skipped. It‚Äôs only been 1 year and a half since the outbreak.
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617063050/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405412588813422594): COVID-19 research is a global phenomenon. In the EU we couldn‚Äôt care less about Trump.  Speaking of, Trump also suggested ‚Äúhitting the body with a tremendous ultraviolet or very powerful light‚Äù or injecting disinfectant, as possible cures that he found very interesting.
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617061033/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405407452246560769): What happened was the mass media wanted to believe in a miracle drug, b/c it makes for good headlines, and we (the public) eventually found that there is no such miracle cure. Trump wanted to believe that, too, b/c his initial handling of COVID-19 was a disaster.
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617053745/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1405399204802052101): This study is an observational one & size is small for its kind.  Large, randomized, controlled clinical trials showed no benefits to using hydroxychloroquine, a drug that also gives heart rhythm problems.  Recommendation wasn‚Äôt wrong based on available information.

Solar is becoming cheaper than coal. But it‚Äôs not enough. Only option to fully replace fossil fuels is currently nuclear power.  I am hopeful that further research will eventually save us, as always.
* [12 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210612161452/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403741259857006597) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1403742420794281984)): There‚Äôs 7.7 billion of us, and fossil fuels are feeding us, connecting us, keeping us warm. And current strategies are pretty dumb. E.g Paris Agreement? A drop in the ocean. France rejecting Brazilian soy? The hypocrisy of a colonial power that has already deforested their lands.

The article is a little shallow at the end.  The problem is that putting brakes on the economy leads to people starving, the main criticism for those that shame people for consuming‚Ä¶

When people discuss whether ‚ÄúNazis are OK‚Äù you can simply say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not welcoming, we don‚Äôt do that here‚Äù, close the conversation & that would be within CoC‚Äôs boundaries.

Adding a CoC is worthless w/o the effort to enforce it.  People doing it should go in with the right expectations, IMO, and for big FOSS communities (or companies) not everyone is capable. But still, it‚Äôs better than alternative IMO.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610120057/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402957020119146500): @milessabin  I voted for ‚Äúnecessary, but insufficient‚Äù actually üòÖ  I meant that CoCs are sufficient when enforced, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what those options meant. CoC can specify ‚Äúbe nice, don‚Äôt be an asshole, don‚Äôt be a bigot‚Äù & that‚Äôs enough, but someone has to confront people.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610110550/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1402944747195486209): Which is totally needed, because truth be told, online communities die by pacifism.  Companies have to deal with this all the time, in private. One problem with open source is that everything is in public, for everyone to see and participate.

B/c we end up censoring or banning people for how they think or how they act. Many of us are liberals, or conservatives, believing in free speech, which we have to balance against the freedom of association‚Ä¶

But slapping a CoC in a repository is worthless if not enforced.  Taking action against a perpetrator is really tough, as it creates conflict and drama, and you‚Äôll always have a lot of critiques heading your way. Not for the faint-hearted.

Society does evolve, the question is how. The left/right polarization doesn‚Äôt really help in understanding the landscape.
* [ 7 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607093935/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1401836075102920708): Centrism is a political position that accepts the compromise b/w social equality and the social hierarchy arising from freedom, and opposes (radical) reforms that would result in a significant shift of society (to the left or right) ‚Äî also called ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù politics.
* [ 6 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210606095929/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1401477962646671361): I am using the same terms that professors of political philosophy are using.  Anything non-center is radical by definition, and the center is not ill-defined at all, in spite of society‚Äôs progress in time.

It was my understanding that they have a more radical past, but that may be gone.  N.b by radical I don‚Äôt mean extremism, but rather non-center. Feminism in the past, now BLM, these are examples of radical movements.

Perception matters and lockdown measures that happened in this pandemic, while warranted by the situation, has consequences.  We now have a far-right party in Romania too, birthed by Covid.

Far-right is on the rise across EU and is IMO the pendulum swinging back.

We are not buying these devices just for taking notes.  Phones w/ styluses work too. Common displays of 6.5‚Äù to 7‚Äù are fine for simple notes.

A waste of paper, disposal will probably not lead to recycling & you have to shred pieces containing sensitive data.  Devices w/ stylus pens should be more popular.

It never happens, yet people believe that power calms down extremists.  In other words, supporting democracy before taking power is still a prerequisite.

So you can‚Äôt separate such tools from their leadership (unless you fork).

Instead of distrusting democracy, we should instead reflect on society‚Äôs problems and then witness the incompetence of our favorites; maybe they‚Äôve lost fair and square.

People make compromises all the time.  That politicians overstate their support, that‚Äôs just marketing. And most ppl can see the silent majority that didn‚Äôt vote.

You can‚Äôt vote away human dignity for example. Or the human rights of minorities. If that happens, it‚Äôs no longer a democracy, but just another tyranny.

We can work with most everything else, but not with those.  Negatives: communism, fascism, islamism.  Positives: liberalism, social democracy, Christian democracy.

Democracy is a societal spirit, an equilibrium b/w opposing forces, but most important liberty vs equality.  This is why pluralism is vital in democracy, to keep that equilibrium. When pluralism is gone, so is democracy.

The apartheid state you‚Äôre talking of is the only democracy there.  I‚Äôm not blaming anyone, as the Middle East is in such a poor state due to hundreds of years of colonialism, but wishful thinking won‚Äôt solve the problem.

Get absorbed by the surrounding states?  You should preach about the evils of nationalism to Syria, Lebanon, Iran and its other neighbors too. That will go well I imagine.

Oppressing minorities was common in 19th-20th century, but those more oppressed were those w/o a country. E.g in interwar Romania that mean Jews and Roma, compared w/ Germans or Hungarians.  Happened all over Europe.

Yes, it‚Äôs a militaristic state, probably b/c all it‚Äôs neighbors want to erase it off the map.  And you‚Äôre commenting from the security of an ongoing colonial empire.

Yes, you can oppose Israel‚Äôs politics and wars. But israelophobia is just antisemitism.

However, philosophies are still useful as a guide, b/c we often have incomplete information and have to fallback to something.  E.g.

I‚Äôve even  seen extra evidence, but was convinced before that, public statements are enough.  Unfortunately Jon being blamed triggers feelings, you cannot combat feelings w/ reason, as we‚Äôve seen w/ other conspiracy theories.

And the popular cryptocoins aren‚Äôt even anonymous, as you can easily trace all transactions.

We can have a say because we can decide to have a say.  Speaking of power imbalance, that‚Äôs also why bosses shouldn‚Äôt date their employees.

Jon‚Äôs in wrong even if this was all an issue of interpretation, as he wrongly claims, as he took advantage as a senior w/ his vast influence in the community, which makes their voices uneven.

Yes, I got that kind of advice. Hard to believe you haven‚Äôt heard of any instances of girls being sexually assaulted in public spaces, w/ their parents then blaming it on how they dressed or other such nonsense, as it‚Äôs super common

I suggest asking for testimonials from a feminist group. Parents can be damaging to a child‚Äôs self-esteem.  Twitter is a bad place for nuance, as context is important. But I hope you‚Äôd do the same if you had sons.

You thought cross-site tracking is bad, how about if the Internet is Facebook?  I also find some of FloC‚Äôs criticism to be a little disingenuous.

B/c we don‚Äôt have microtransactions, so w/o a way to pay for reading an article, many publishers will die.  For advertising, targeting is cost effective, small businesses being less able to compete otherwise w/ big players.

Hurting online publishers & small advertising is pushing people towards centralized gardens, away from open web.

Women suffering from harassment/sexual assault yields advice like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear sexy clothes, or walk at night, or share an airbnb‚Ä¶‚Äù, amounting to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a woman‚Äù and ‚Äúmen will be men‚Äù.  Stop that, she isn‚Äôt to blame.

The point of paying taxes is precisely that you don‚Äôt get to choose how those taxes get spent.

It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the ‚Äútheory‚Äù is not based on science, but on rationalism at best. Our beliefs about what‚Äôs best are often a religion.

But we must acknowledge that biggest change in 20th century is people now have access to an abundance of cheap calories.

This is a hormone emitted by the fat cells, for communicating fullness to the hypothalamus. The problem is  it works like a ping, but quantity stops mattering. Supplementation doesn‚Äôt work, the brain will just ignore it.

The body does defend its weight (the body weight setpoint), even against overeating (e.g. increases body temperature and fidgeting), but it‚Äôs not doing a good job when weight is going up.

It‚Äôs why people that lost weight can regain that weight much faster than the first time. Because when the overeating comes back, storage is prioritized, to prepare for winter.

There‚Äôs an actual drug that prevents lipolysis. Insulin doesn‚Äôt, but this drug can.  Well, guess what, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Metabolism rate stays the same, and the people taking it don‚Äôt gain more weight. And drugs are tested in doubly-blind RCTs.

We also tried pills for reducing the appetite, but appetite always comes back, as the body gains resistance to those pills.

E.g we discovered leptin. Fat people have ‚Äúleptin resistance‚Äù, that determines ‚Äúbody weight setpoint‚Äù, people feel the need to eat more, as brain is not getting satiety signals

Indeed, highly-palatable foods override our satiety cues. We will overeat milk chocolate, and via a dopamine-driven feedback loop, we will keep keep eating it.

If we relied on our own logic and senses, we‚Äôd think the earth is flat, or just not think about it.  Your diet works possibly b/c you eliminate hyper-palatable, highly-caloric foods; and if you can adhere to it, great.

One claim is that insulin prevents lipolysis. It does not, and even if it did, it wouldn‚Äôt matter (we have actual drugs that prevent lipolysis). Another is that fat people have a slower metabolism. They don‚Äôt, their metabolism is faster.

But I have doubts about Brave‚Äôs ability to fix it, when first-party advertorials in reputable newspapers can‚Äôt. Also Brave already promotes shady crypto stuff.  Scams are spectrum. Will Brave get rid of political ads? What about illegal Windows licensing deals?

This list is smaller than EasyList / EasyPrivacy, but fairly effective for getting rid of the most egregious actors, esp in strict mode. New Firefox for Android also advertised uBO.

But it will continue to work in Firefox.  Pi-hole / NextDNS can protect against CNAME cloaking. I agree that DNS blocking isn‚Äôt enough, as it can‚Äôt block individual scripts on first-party domains.

B/c most don‚Äôt want any ads, even if some express guilt.  uBlock Origin has been growing, it has no company behind that can be attacked or bought. The industry is terrified by it, while Adblock Plus is an ally.

Similarly the survival of businesses isn‚Äôt a consumer problem.  And you‚Äôd think consumers willv somehow decide it‚Äôs for their own good. No they won‚Äôt.

And this time people even have the moral high ground.

When a service gets more popular, prices go down, not up.  I want nothing less but to block all ads. Whether that‚Äôs a solution or not for businesses, it isn‚Äôt my problem, I‚Äôm not a charity.

Chrome + Pi-hole, or NextDNS, or Adguard DNS is just as good as Brave on Android. And Safari on iOS w/ Wipr is much better.  Mobile Vivaldi & Edge have integrated ads blockers too, better than Brave‚Äôs.

Their business model is advertisement. Crypto integrations, advertised images, ads in ‚ÄúBrave Today‚Äù, that‚Äôs just the beginning. https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13222

Romanians don‚Äôt have a culture for liberal democracy, we‚Äôve only been acquainted since the 90‚Äôs, before that we‚Äôve had feudalism, fascism, communism,  in that order üòÖ  I fear polarization, but it‚Äôs never quaint to worry about your democracy.

Esp since it‚Äôs rare for a president to not win a second term. My impression is that his supporters are a loud minority ü§û

IMO no, b/c the economic fabric of the internet is broken, with or w/o facebook. And there will be data abuse, for as long as we are products in attention economy.

And advertising companies will do anything to get data and to milk that data in order to monetize you, b/c you‚Äôre the product.

E.g Google has done great things, but it‚Äôs still an ads company, w/ the same incentive structure, and same potential for abuse, even if they behaved more responsibly. https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1345677279322636293

In my country I vote for center-right parties (yet in the US I wouldn‚Äôt be republican).

Today it‚Äôs used to serve ads, tomorrow it may lower your credit score.  Data collection in itself is immoral, unless it‚Äôs done with an explicit purpose that the user knows about, and by law is only used for that purpose.

And while his language was clearly unprofessional, and against UEFA, I don‚Äôt have a single acquaintance that hasn‚Äôt spoken in his support. None. We couldn‚Äôt even agree that his behavior was unprofessional.

I can see it in my country. We‚Äôve just had a case of a soccer referrer using ‚Äúthat black man‚Äù for identification (in Romanian ‚Äúnegru‚Äù being ‚Äúblack‚Äù, but sounding like the n-word)‚Ä¶

I disagree w/ censoring misinformation regarding vaccines, 5G networks, election fraud, or whatever the today‚Äôs conspiracy is. It‚Äôs deeply illiberal.  And even as I respect the private property of Twitter/Facebook/YouTube, due to their monopoly, they are public utilities.

Today we‚Äôre talking about censoring bigotry. Tomorrow we‚Äôll be talking about censoring ideologies that are not totalitarian. Or uncomfortable news.

But mobs can have an amplifying effect, and we can talk about reprisals, instead of just criticism, which can have a chilling effect on expression.  Although if we‚Äôre honest, at-will employment is worse.

Mobs w/ pitchforks doing their own justice happens when the justice system becomes injust (and w/ systemic racism, it is injust almost by definition).  But such a society is a sick society & mobs become part of the problem.

But due to innovation and the free market, the world hasn‚Äôt gone to shit.  If I get fed up by macOS, fact of the matter is that‚Äôs an opportunity for the competition to win me as a customer.
* [26 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126170211/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1332006232270528512): It‚Äôs not a potential inconvenience. My wifi works on Mac. Never had any issues with my webcam, or microphone either.  Every time I did a conference call in Linux, I felt like saying a prayer before doing it.
* [26 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126120351/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1331930794307297282): IMO the problem is one of incentive structure.  Server-side Linux is polished and works well, but that‚Äôs b/c server-side Linux has paying customers.  For consumers, the problem w/ FOSS is that business models are difficult. It‚Äôs why we have privacy-invading ads funding Firefox.

I do believe individuals know their needs better, which is the basis of liberalism.  Devs have needs, like putting food on the table, learning, making meaningful contributions. If nobody pays them, I wouldn‚Äôt blame it on them for the state of desktop Linux.

Just like in communism, nobody cares about shared resources, and the companies selling support have a perverse incentive to not improve the status quo.  If I chose a community distro, would my Wifi work?
* [26 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126082844/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1331877475039776769): I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs such a good thing anymore. It certainly depends.  It reminds me of communism ‚Ä¶ when everybody owns something, then nobody does.  Tried installing Ubuntu 20.04, and a perfectly functioning wifi in 18.04 is now no longer working. I don‚Äôt have time for that.

Only exception is Apple dropping 32-bit support.

Go to any Hacker News thread on nutrition, you‚Äôll see it.  It‚Äôs terrifying. School is obviously failing people on things that matter (critical thinking, science and civic education).

There are disparities b/w countries in terms of resources, and culture, that need to be taken into account.  Note Singapore is a super rich, and fairly small country (France is ~12 times bigger)

And a centrally planned economy (aka communism) can lock a billion people up, but I wouldn‚Äôt implement the strategies of a country that routinely violates human rights.

In April I remember several claims made, about countries like Russia and India, supposedly imposing travel restrictions early. Fast forward 2-3 months and they were overwhelmed.  Careful to not count the winners before the war is over.

We can‚Äôt get rid of virus via restrictions; only flatten curve. And restrictions are less effective in second wave.  I‚Äôve read even w/ vaccine it will take until 2024 to get back to normal. We should brace ourselves üòâ

Thinking it could be controlled requires some proof. ‚ÄúFlattening curve‚Äù is the best we could hope for. Genie is out of the bag.  Even w/ vaccine, current projections say we‚Äôll have herd immunity in 2024, so brace yourself.
* [19 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201119154911/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1329451550490718216): It‚Äôs a balancing act. An economic crisis, the poverty resulting from economic slowdown, are also grave concerns.  You can‚Äôt sequester people indefinitely, as it‚Äôs a freedom restriction, and many people will be willing to fight for their freedom to move. Also mental health issues.

It‚Äôs like saying that gamblers or drug addicts are entirely responsible for their affliction.

Our attention is the commodity, even if we use ads blocking.

But unfortunately that‚Äôs not enough. Ads blockers aren‚Äôt enough.  The problem transcends tracking, or the annoyance of ads. The other problem is the attention seeking, which we now see in the proliferation of false news.
* [ 3 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201004124815/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1312732398644342784) ([live](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1312318614431727616)): ‚ÄúThe Social Dilemma‚Äù rings very true, I‚Äôve nodded continuously while watching the movie.  The ads business model provides perverse incentives for keeping us hooked, as our attention is the product being sold, aka the ‚Äúattention economy‚Äù. https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/

We dodged a bullet in 2019 b/c our supreme-leader-wannabe was convicted to jail for corruption.  I suspect we were lucky b/c the governing party is filled w/ idiots.

He‚Äôs saying Hungary has a democratically elected government.  Don‚Äôt be fooled. If a democracy is not _liberal_, then it‚Äôs just another tyranny.

And maybe my memory is playing tricks, sure, I can give you that.

And it‚Äôs also OK to change your mind.  And maybe also accept that many people have justification for being upset when seeing hints of support for predeterminism, eugenics, etc.

Here he wishes eternal damnation on someone, then doing personal attacks that are very out of place.

I am interested however in the general pattern of believing in predeterminism, which is actually the point of that infamous quoted tweet.  And I did not ban him. I remember he left for Gab, unhappy w/ Twitter‚Äôs algos, another pattern.

And context is gone of course, b/c you deleted it (which was your right, not suggesting otherwise).  Are you anti free speech BTW? Because that includes critiques too.

And maybe finding ‚Äúracial diffences in brain size‚Äù really isn‚Äôt something that should be suggested as a topic. People searching for that, already know what to search for.

But I‚Äôm always happy to have a conversation about it.

Does it bother you?  There‚Äôs also an obvious alternative explanation: DDG is used by a group of ppl not representative as a sample of the population, or at least of Google‚Äôs market.

You claimed it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsingle tweet‚Äù, which is false, b/c I followed you through LambdaConf and that James Damore memo & remember seeing questionable opinions; which you then deleted.  You might be just a contrarian. So please share your opinions on race science.

All cells pass knowledge when they replicate. And we evolved the means to bypass normal evolutionary mechanisms for transmitting  knowledge.  We are unique in nature, and we have to be careful about taking inspiration from animal models.

We can simply teach our children to be nice, as a conscious decision, such that they don‚Äôt have to wait for the expression of genes.

But because we can pass knowledge by language, aka culture, we can ‚Äúevolve‚Äù without needing biological evolution, and we‚Äôve done so quite successfully.

So yes, we have a culture, we are passing notions of justice, of equality before the law to our children, that could be good for us, even if ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù.

Well, fuck yeah, humans had fire to predigest their food.  Similarly, we could pass knowledge via language.

Yes, animals can have a natural order, but humans are very unlike all other animals, we have a very complex society, and all notions of a natural order have been debunked thus far.

I know this is long after the fact, but that James Damore memo was BS, even if we don‚Äôt debunk its pseudoscience. Yet echoes of that memo remain.

Maybe he did, but I have a short memory. Can you point it out?  That sure sounds like a statement of fact. Would you be OK with receiving a C&D letter for this accusation?

It‚Äôs sweet that you feel that way üôÇ  Has that ever happened in real life? Not how societies work. If this goes through, the drama is just starting üòâ

AFAIK only 10% of defamation lawsuits are ruled in favor of plaintiff, as most are baseless. A lawyer doing fact checking can cost a fortune, so biased for the rich.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726153641/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287411294853902336): Someone can be a good teacher, a friend, and a bully at the same time. Don‚Äôt deny the testimonials of others based on your feelings or anecdotes.  ‚ÄúMistakes were made‚Äù isn‚Äôt an apology.  Cease & desist letters are a coercion technique, used by bullies and are anti free speech.

Yet he has his freedom of speech, and is entitled to his opinions, just like everyone else. C&C is a bullying tactic.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726122314/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287361696202448898): So you‚Äôre aliking the freedom of speech of someone criticising on the Internet to a 2 years prison sentence? Wow.

Yet you‚Äôve built a straw man. The tangent was totally unnecessary and does NOT justify your support for the C&C letter.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726082137/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287301884034920449): Anyone can defend themselves in a court of law, of course.  I also have the right to point to the double standard and campaign against defamation laws.  So we‚Äôll have to agree to disagree.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726081451/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287300107642314752): That‚Äôs false. It doesn‚Äôt cost Travis nothing to have these opinions üòâ  Usually reputations are affected in both directions.

Free speech is a doubly edge sword. If you don‚Äôt like what people say about you, talk back. Maybe start w/ an apology, which the plaintiff proved incapable of.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726080016/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287296533902307328): I‚Äôd argue that there‚Äôs nothing to settle.  Calling someone a ‚Äúnazi apologist‚Äù is an opinion, protected by free speech, unless any of the presented facts, on which this opinion is based, proves to be false.  And lawsuit threats are traditionally a clear intimidation tactic.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726074603/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287292745321676801): A court of law is biased towards those that can pay the better lawyers, for longer.  I trust a court of law to protect my liberal rights more than I trust a mob, for sure, however defamation laws are anti free speech and protect the rich and powerful.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726073758/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287289338380922880): It‚Äôs a marketing term for sure, appealing to feelings, to provoke anger, however people like Curtis Yarvin deserve the label, even if their views might be a little different, more nuanced than those that nazis and fascists had. This is the 21st century after all.
* [26 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726073758/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1287289338380922880): Nazism & fascism are ideologies. As such, they transcend the political parties of Germany from beginning of 20th century.  What would it take to be a nazi or fascist today? Party membership? Pro views on eugenics, race, slavery? Denying white supremacy? Being anti-democracy?

If not talking about hypotheticals, which of the presented facts are false? Note the defendant provides a detailed bibliography.  While public opinions can hurt one‚Äôs reputation, opinions are still protected by free speech & people can still freely associate.
* [22 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200723045343/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1285841842303643655): There will never be one community. Even within sub-communities, there are tribes.

Censorship is censorship, even if in some instances it might be justified. On the topic at hand, IMO defamation laws protect the rich and powerful, not living up to expectations. And I value my free speech more than hypotheticals.

* [21 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200724142455/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1285667738011172871): I can tell you that in the US I wouldn‚Äôt sue, because I don‚Äôt have the resources, and this is coming from a middle class white stem guy, I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like for the less privileged.  Also I don‚Äôt care about hypotheticals.

* [21 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721210248/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1285660596814454784): Let‚Äôs not argue over textbook definions, or succumb to identify politics.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship

But I don‚Äôt believe the plaintiff is right here, I don‚Äôt think any presented facts are false. And if you ever find yourself in that situation, write an article, or apologise.  Free speech works both ways
* [21 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200722053310/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1285655799264620545): Banning an article & have the author face legal fines is censorship by definition. Whether it‚Äôs just, that‚Äôs separate. Note state-sponsored censorship (1) robs the defendant of any choice and (2) is quasi-permanent. State yields a power that Internet mobs and private orgs don‚Äôt.
* [21 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200722053310/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1285655799264620545): Blocking on Twitter isn‚Äôt a statement. Yes we don‚Äôt see eye to eye on many issues.  I still think this is despicable and I‚Äôm still going to voice my support.  Also state-sponsored censorship is the worst kind of censorship.

Spare me the mental gymnastics.  Pro-Tip: before going down the path of lawsuit threats, you might want to try apologizing first ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Defamation laws are state-sponsored censorship, favoring the rich and powerful.

I have friends like that which I‚Äôm still trying to change, but the phenomenon is still bigotry w/ some feelings of guilt mixed in. They‚Äôll cheer for the bigots ‚Äùtelling the truth‚Äù on TV, and they‚Äôll support legislature to suppress LGBT rights.

The Bible itself includes hate speech. Should we moderate it and is this  hate speech?  We can debate nuance, but equality before law is a liberal value that needs preserving too.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708174657/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1280908963933020166): Yes, I fear that too, but with the law there‚Äôs a fine line everywhere you look.  Hate speech is incitement to hatred based on race, ethnicity, religion or sex. European countries managed to work with such a definition w/o including ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in it.

Racism is unjust.  ‚ÄúCancel culture‚Äù is about people taking matters into their own hands due to a malfunctioning justice system. As long as institutionalized injustice continues, they are justified.

A claim is made: extreme tolerance leads to disappearance of tolerance. I have a feeling this is ‚Äúnot even wrong‚Äù and yet used in debates b/c it sounds truthy in context, so we promote phylosophy of an autocracy advocate.

Is it based on empirical evidence at all, or is it just armchair philosophy? Plato came up w/ it to justify autocracy, possibly while on drugs.

In doing so they also censored reports from medical personnel of incompetence & corruption, w/ threats of imprisonment. All the while doing a really poor job at educating the public.  7/10

B/c him too, just like Trump before him, is a signal that the US society is turning away from liberal values. Trump is a symptom of a bigger problem.  4/10

Liberal, as in emphasis on individual rights, minimal government, equality before the law, tolerance, everything that fascism isn‚Äôt.  3/10

But that‚Äôs a false choice ‚Äî free speech is necessary for protecting minorities or reason.  Democracy w/o liberal values, w/o free speech, is just another tyranny, one of the majority.  1/10

But such companies are founded in tech hubs and don‚Äôt need to scale the head count, being able to get by with 2-3 people that they can find locally.  I find it regrettable tbh.

Mind you hiring remotely outside EU would be win, due to economic reasons ‚Äî people outside the US / EU are cheaper to hire. But travelling or security reqs are issues.

Consultancy companies are often fully remote, but the consultancy gigs are many times for big companies that will not approve non-EU consultants due to security reasons.

Of course I may be alone in opposing fascism/nazism and communism, as it seems liberalism is in short supply these days.   And before sweeping generalizations are made, as people apparently love to do that, I‚Äôm speaking solely in my name.

While we can agree on the end (human rights, equality for all), we‚Äôll always disagree on the means. I could never see eye to eye on the means to achieve equality w/ people believing in Marx/Lenin theories, as our views are fundamentally different.

His authoritarian outbursts could be seen as what‚Äôs needed for law and order to prevail. Look at Putin or Erdogan. Another factor is that his failure to respond to Covid-19 might get buried.

Problem with the protests are the crimes (looting, destruction of property). This gives him ammunition to further polarize society, which was already polarized, Trump being a symptom, not a cauze.

I‚Äôm talking of  @Monix  due to its influence on cancelation.  Cats-Effect has been a great collaboration effort especially b/w developers of 2 competing libraries: fs2 and Monix (plus http4s, etc).

* [ 7 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922052657/https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/1170252104906227713): üëç indeed, although that too originated in a discussion with SystemFw after my constant bickering that we still don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcontinual‚Äù, a discussion in which John was involved and then he ran with it.  I‚Äôm not holding it against him and that you implemented it is good validation.

But we are certainly thinking about what to do there and you‚Äôre free to join us when we‚Äôll discuss it.

Most of the work that we do is inspired by Haskell‚Äôs IO. There‚Äôs also the issue that math is discovered not invented.  This is why I‚Äôm always wary of taking credit for anything I do, so I don‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs also ‚Äústart‚Äù, Fiber‚Äôs side-kick. I kind of regret introducing ‚Äústart‚Äù and advise people to not use it. That one comes from fs2 and Haskell first.

I refer you still to 3.0.0-M1 and here‚Äôs the signature for which John later claimed credit as well:   https://github.com/monix/monix/blob/v3.0.0-M1/monix-eval/shared/src/main/scala/monix/eval/Task.scala#L1308  pic.twitter.com/kTxKu0uLMJ

This is a general gotcha in Haskell, you have to mask ‚Äúacquire‚Äù and ‚Äúrelease‚Äù by yourself.

Can you see any ZIO btw in sight? This isn‚Äôt to say that we weren‚Äôt aware of ZIO implementing it, or that we didn‚Äôt make changes related to ZIO.

It‚Äôs irrelevant that people not involved w/ alt-right participated w/ funding, b/c we aren‚Äôt talking about them. And b/c money taints, you can say no. Do you expect politicians receiving money from big oil to promote green energy? I hope not.

When you pick a side, acting on it (e.g. becoming vocal about it, organizing events), you‚Äôre no longer talking about tolerance, you‚Äôre talking about acceptance at the very least, or even endorsement.

I live in Romania, we don‚Äôt have the social struggles from US, so I can‚Äôt judge that. It‚Äôs all about context.

Some social struggles are real, but if we are removed from context, we lack full picture.  This is why I also dislike progressives shaming people by mere association‚Ä¶

But it‚Äôs missing the forest from the trees and this left narrative naturally invites censorship and speaking as a child of communism, censorship is not going to be in your favor.

European countries do not have the diversity of the US and its experience with integrating immigrants. And when you don‚Äôt listen to society‚Äôs fears, Trump, Brexit and Le Pen happen.

I empathize *a lot* and agree w/ wanting to get rid of pejorative words, but Romani is a terrible name to pick for an unrelated ethnic group.

But the situation is complicated and the media reports of discrimination here are overblown. Yes, there are cases, but overall it‚Äôs pretty good to be a minority in Romania üòâ

Romanians in our language is spelled ‚Äúrom√¢ni‚Äù, so making Romanians accept ‚ÄúRomani‚Äù is a showstopper. And we do have a sizable Roma community, for which we‚Äôve been discriminated in the EU. I believe the UK used this in their Brexit campaign‚Ä¶

Attacking people negates dialog and education opportunities, it‚Äôs why that quoted tweet offended me.
