<article id="archive">
  <h1>Archive</h1>

  <p>
    This is where all old, deprecated or poorly written articles come
    to die. I won't delete them, they are just banned from the home
    page ...
  </p>

  <ol class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}      
      {% if post.archive %}
      {% include render-post-link.html %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ol>  
</article>
