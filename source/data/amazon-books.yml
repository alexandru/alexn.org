    Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but
    JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been
    developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This
    authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a
    subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and
    maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to
    create truly extensible and efficient code.

    This is a hands-on book with plenty of well-explained code. Each
    chapter has a standalone project in which a complete web
    application with specific features of a social networking site is
    emphasized. The final chapter of the book is a project that has a
    complete and fully developed social networking site. Each chapter
    begins with a brief description of the features of the Internet
    service and the market it is within. After extracting the main
    features of the service, the chapter goes into explaining how a
    clone of the service can be designed, followed by a short
    description of the technologies and platforms being used.

    HTML5 and CSS3 are the future of web development, but you don't
    have to wait to start using them. Even though the specification is
    still in development, many modern browsers and mobile devices
    already support HTML5 and CSS3. This book gets you up to speed on
    the new HTML5 elements and CSS3 features you can use right now,
    and backwards compatible solutions ensure that you don't leave

    Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell. With Seven
    Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the
    syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace
    online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful
    exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than
    serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven
    Languages hits what's essential and unique about each
    language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok
    new languages.
