I have been working on Epigrams, a really exciting startup for some
time now and have been loving every minute of it. For me it's been my
dream coming to fruition.

We are looking for engineers capable of solving hard problems and that
are willing to relocate either in **Bucharest, Romania**, or in **Palo Alto,
California**. Working remotely without relocation is possible, but we
prefer candidates that are willing to be local.

Let me tell you what I love about it.

On the server-side, we use functional programming, Scala, Play2, Akka,
Hive, EC2, ELB, ElasticCache, Redshift, Heroku and on the client-side
CoffeeScript/Less/HTML5 (seriously considering ClojureScript), plus
native iOS/Android. It's pretty cool that we use whatever felt
necessary for increasing productivity, for solving scalability issues,
it's awesome that we emphasise on functional programming and that we
bring back the lost meaning of "cutting-edge", however that's not the
only thing I love about our startup.

More important is that in our startup, one is free to think outside of
the box and to innovate. And I love it, being again, not just about
the technical problems we've been facing, like the huge scalability
issues we have, or the processing of big-data for business
intelligence using smart algorithms, or the client-side work that
involves dealing with good design and latency issues.

You see, work doesn't involve the bureaucracy of big companies, like
sending forms for SOX compliance, or dealing with meetings for
establishing what shade of blue to use, or working for clients that
track your time and that can't express their needs in words, or
working on yet another soul-sucking CRM. On the whole it's also the
motivation for working on a product I can say it's partially my baby
and that has the potential to be a game changer. And seeing your baby
in production and producing revenue and value is the kind of
motivation one needs to produce truly outstanding work that one can be
proud of.
