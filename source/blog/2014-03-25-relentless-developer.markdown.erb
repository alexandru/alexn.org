I don't feel the need to play games and ever since I was 14 something
much deeper and fulfilling took over my attention span.

Every day I evolve, I learn about new algorithms, new techniques or
new tools, I solve enigmas and I build. I like to think that each day
I grow in level and I'm better than yesterday. Contemporary games pale
in comparison with the best MMORPG ever - being a software developer.

Software components with nicknames such as Godzilla, Predator, Gekko,
Shifter, Engraver, Dracula, Asset-Engine and Vpp-Engine have been
sprinkled with drops of sweat and adrenaline, some of them being
corpses left to be revived.

Silicon Valley's culture is one of failure, you throw lumps of mud on
a wall and see what sticks. Projects and startups die in the sound of
applause, much like how gladiators were meeting their end on the sands
of the Colosseum. Big chunks of code, whole components and even entire
apps are thrown to the trash bin, only to be started over again.
Perseverance is the key in everything you do.

Sometimes it's hard for me to externalize my feelings to my wife, my
family, or even towards other developers. Day after day I'm experiencing
the full range of human emotions, like hatred, stress, anger, anxiety,
fear, jealousy, sadness, satisfaction, motivation, courage,
wonderment, pride and happiness.

Some days I wonder if there's any point or purpose in anything I'm
doing. Some days the repeated failures are simply suffocating. To work
on a single problem for 3 weeks and to witness your application
crashing and die in production, after days of testing in which
everything seemed OK, is *soul-breaking*. And then there are days in
which I enter a state of lethargy, not giving a crap about anything.

Today is not one of those days. Today I feel like a god witnessing his
creation.
