The course is offered again on Coursera, starting on March 25th. You
can enroll here: [www.coursera.org/course/progfun](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun)

I took this course last year. The result, besides learning a fun
language or to think in a referential-transparent style, is a
statement of accomplishment. It's not worth much and I argued until
now that it doesn't matter if you're seeking employment. However for
beginners it does matter and while interviewing people I found myself
pleasantly surprised by a rookie who took this course.

To see how that looks like, here is mine (PDF link):

On the course itself I liked it a lot. It's a little incomplete, but
they promissed a follow-up. It doesn't assume much prior experience or
knowledge of Scala, but it is a difficult one. And it was worth every
minute of it.
