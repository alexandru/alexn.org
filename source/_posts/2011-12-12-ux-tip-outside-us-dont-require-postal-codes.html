  I have this annoyance with US-centric UIs that started to bug me
  even on a product I'm working on and I didn't notice it until I
  tested the user experience for other countries. Many apps developed
  primarily for US customers are making the postal code (zipcode in US
  parlance) mandatory and this is a pain in the ass, let me explain
  why.
</p>

<p>
  You see, postal codes are useful for sorting the mail to be
  delivered. And in the rest of the world (well, not all, most of it)
  postal codes haven't transcended their primary use-case. In many
  countries this code is not even required for sending a letter. This
  is because either the sorting of letters / packages is still done
  manually, or because the system in place has some other means of
  efficiently sorting the mail which precludes the usage of postal
  codes.
</p>

<p>
  I live in Eastern Europe. Down here nobody knows their postal
  code. Nobody even cares about it. Nobody uses it anywhere, not even
  when sending letters or postcards, even though the postal office
  would thank you if you did.
</p>

<p>
  My postal code is not written on my ID card, which is EU-compliant
  and with which I can travel anywhere inside EU, without needing a
  passport. It isn't on any legally binding contract I ever
  signed. This code for me is just an optional formality.
</p>

<p>
  So when US-centric forms ask me for my postal code, <b>I have to
  either look it up, or I end-up providing a fake one</b>, as
  the postal office or anybody else doesn't really care about
  correctness or the presence of it. And I never bother to remember it
  as I changed addresses a couple of times. My address on Amazon has a
  fake postal code. The packages are arriving just fine, straight at
  my doorstep.

<p>
  Besides forms for filling out addresses, one other important
  use-case is as a cheap way of getting a location. In the US
  everybody and their dog knows their zipcode. When getting a taxi,
  the driver asks you for the destination zipcode. He then proceeds to
  enter it on his GPS device. And all is well and everybody is happy.
</p>

<p>
  This model has been copied in web applications. Many web apps ask
  users for their zipcode, to infer their locations. This works for
  businesses too, as it's a lot cheaper to give customers a
  zipcode. However, this is basically useless in many parts of the
  world.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Ireland doesn't even have postal codes</b>. Few countries have
  postal codes databases with geo location available that you can rely
  on. Asking for the postal code is the exception, rather than the
  norm. GPS systems are configured to work with street name and
  number. It's not optimal, true, but that's how it is. And in a web
  app if you're interested in the user's city to get a search radius,
  then ask for the user's city.
</p>

<p>
  I would go even further - I would simply NOT show a postal code
  field outside the US, even if optional, unless delivery of packages
  by mail is involved and the country's postal office is known to
  delay packages without one provided. Because many users are simply
  going to feel compelled to answer it and that's just bad user
  experience.
