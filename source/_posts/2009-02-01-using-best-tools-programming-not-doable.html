<p>
  There's something that bothers me when it comes to starting a new
  project. You can't really use the best tool for a certain job, if that
  tool is not integrated with the rest of your platform. Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
  At our startup we pride ourselves with our pragmatism. We are true
  polyglots :) capable of diving in any project, no matter the language
  it was written in. This also gives us the power to make educated
  choices about the technologies we're going to use for our own gigs.
</p>

<p>
  Our programming language of choice is Perl, because of its flexibility
  and because usually there's no need to reinvent the wheel since you
  can find a CPAN module for almost anything.
</p>

<p>
  But recently I began experimenting with data-mining techniques, flirting with various NLP libraries. You can find almost anything in CPAN's <a target="_blank" href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=AI%3A%3A&amp;mode=module">AI:: namespace</a>. But I also knew about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>, a Python collection of libraries with excellent documentation, and I also found <a target="_blank" href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/">OpenNLP</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/">MontyLingua</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/conceptnet/">ConceptNet</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/">link-grammar</a> and various <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.nict.go.jp/x/x161/members/mutiyama/software.html">Ruby modules</a>.
</p>


<p>
  And all of a sudden I got cold feet. Java packages in OpenNLP may have
  the advantage of speed (just a guess and it doesn't matter for the
  purpose of this discussion). NLTK has pedigree and great
  documentation, not to mention that many books related to NLP, AI and
  data mining have Python samples (for example I own <a target="_blank"
  href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/">Programming
  Collective Intelligence</a> and <a target="_blank"
  href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">AIMA</a>). Usually the solution is
  straightforward: you test all the options, and choose the best one.
</p>

<p>
  But what if you want to combine them?
</p>

<p>
  Well, then you're shit out of luck. Surely you can do that with
  inter-process communication, but for that you'll have to write
  glue-code and pay the price for extra latency, bandwidth and memory
  ... parsing millions of documents, moving results between processes,
  it's not really practical. Perl does have <a target="_blank"
  href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Inline-Java/Java.pod">Inline::Java</a>,
  but I would only use it in extreme situations.
</p>

<p>
  That's why there's so much wheel reinvention around. Unless a module
  is written in C, for which any language has a FFI, almost nobody wants
  to use a Java module from Ruby, or a Python module from Perl. That's
  why there's <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a>, and then
  there's <a target="_blank"
  href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene.NET</a>, <a target="_blank"
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene">CLucene</a>, <a target="_blank"
  href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2005/10/lucene_in_ruby_name_ferret_thi.html">Ferret</a>,
  <a target="_blank"
      href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.html#zend.search.lucene.introduction">Zend_Search_Lucene</a>,
  <a target="_blank"
      href="http://search.cpan.org/~tmtm/Plucene-1.25/lib/Plucene.pm">Plucene</a>
  and <a target="_blank" href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene4c/">Lucene4c</a>.
</p>

<p>
  What is really needed is a universal virtual machine with a flexible
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaobject_Protocol">MOP</a>,
  allowing seamless communication between languages. I'm happy there
  are a couple of efforts in this space, including <a target="_blank"
  href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a>, and the <a target="_blank"
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Language_Runtime">DLR</a>. Also,
  the biggest obstacles of alternative implementations are the modules
  written in C. Fortunately, JRuby/Rubinius have a brand new
  implementation-independent <a target="_blank"
  href="http://blog.headius.com/2008/10/ffi-for-ruby-now-available.html">FFI</a>,
  and <a target="_blank"
  href="http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/">Ironclad</a> will allow
  IronPython users to use CPython extensions (number one on their list
  being numpy).
</p>

<p>
  These developments make me happy :)
