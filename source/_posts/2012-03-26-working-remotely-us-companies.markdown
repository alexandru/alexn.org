I've got years of experience working remotely and collaborating with
American companies and I like it.

When I started working as a software developer, I did it to support my
small family. My first salary was $150 per month (I shit you not) and
now if I said that I earn a lot more than that, it would be an
understatement.

Unfortunately, the further you live from Silicon Valley, London or
Tokio, the less options you have. But we are also fortunate, because
good developers are in short supply and in high demand. And even
though there are big hurdles in working with people remotely, you can
overcome your limitations and live a good life, without having to
necessarily go through the painful process of relocating to another
country.

## 1. Why Not Migrate to Another Country?

You could. I haven't (yet).

I live in
[Bucharest, Romania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), not the
greatest city in the world, or the cheapest, or the cleanest. It's in
fact quite a shitty city by my own standards. The software industry is
also underdeveloped and employers expect to hire heroes for
peanuts. The projects you end up working on are mostly throwaways that
could be safely outsourced.

There are exceptions of course, as we also have a couple of shiny
startups working on cool stuff, but those are few and far between.

There are however advantages to staying close to where you were born,
versus just migrating to another country. My parents are 120 km (75
miles) away, a distance which I can cover in an hour of driving. I
also have a wife and a son and if I were to migrate to another
country, even if we plan to move together and achieve permanent
residency, this also means I'll get separated from my family for
several months at least.

This doesn't bode well for my priorities. Nothing compares to seeing
your son walk for the first time or speak his first words. I've been
there and trust me, nothing is more important than that. I also can't
get separated from my wife for more than 2 weeks. I need her, I rely
on her.

I might also add here that at least the U.S. government doesn't really
want me, otherwise they wouldn't make getting a H-1B visa so painful,
so I would rather migrate to a country where I feel welcome, but
that's another discussion.

And I did travel all over Europe, I also visited the SF Bay Area, but
while traveling is fun there's this constant feeling in the back of my
head that I can't get rid of ... *I'm a stranger here*. I actually
admire people that can adapt and belong to wherever they go.

Plus, as far as my country is concerned, I hate my city but I've got
other options. And you know that saying: *a bird in your hand is worth
two in the bush*.

## 2. Going Remote is Hard

The greatest advantage we have is that we can work from anywhere in
the world, as long as we've got a good Internet connection.

This is also the greatest disadvantage, because you're also competing
against a global pool of developers. The U.S. is a pretty big country,
with over 300 million inhabitants and it's constantly churning out
lots of software developers from its universities. Many of them are
really good too and deserve the 6-figures salaries they are getting.

You're also competing against Chinese or Indian developers, which may
have a bad reputation for delivering low quality work, but the talent
is there, it's just underestimated and underused.

You also have the disadvantage of being in a completely different
timezone. It makes communications a bitch to deal with (more on that
later), which is why companies always prefer local developers first.

Let me make this clear, YES, you can earn a salary that's 3 times
bigger than the local maximum, you can also work on really cool
projects while enjoying a tea at your favorite coffee-shop, and you
can change the world from the comfort of your home ... but you've got
to be really, really good to do it.

Like, you know how you take pride in being in the top 10% or
something? Well, that's not enough and once you end up competing with
global resources you'll also have to cope with the fact that there are
a lot of developers out there more talented than you.

But fret not, if you're having doubts about your capabilities, that's
normal. People that are really good at what they do, don't necessarily
know it, as the more knowledge you have, the more doubt you have as
you realize that you don't know enough.

Plus, it's not just a matter of technical skills, it's also a matter
of *marketing*. Marketing is actually more important. It's not enough
to be good at what you do, people also have to know about it.

## 3. How to Find Remote Work

Get in front of the right people! It's that simple and once you do,
they'll come to you.

- start a well-written blog, the single most effective marketing tool
  for our profession;
- register a GitHub account and start committing your by-products to
  it;
  
People that have software development in their blood should have no
problems doing the above. Don't expect overnight-success though. It
takes time. 

### 3.1. Advice On Blogging

First, you really should read on the experience of talented
bloggers. [Technical Blogging](http://pragprog.com/book/actb/technical-blogging)
for instance is a good book by
[Antonio Cangiano](http://antoniocangiano.com/). Go read it.

Now, take the advice you receive with a grain of salt, because the
truth is you have to find your *own style for blogging*.

For instance, everybody recommends to write at least 1 article per
week, preferably 2 articles. That's bullshit. It works well for many
people, however if your style tends towards long and well-written
articles, that's an advantage because not many people are able to do
that.

But it requires constant effort. It's fine to publish one article per
month, but never let a week go by without working on an article.

### 3.2. Advice On Open-Source / GitHub Contributions

You've got a lot of useful modules in your line of work already,
modules that your current employer won't mind if you shared with the
world.

So you just need to keep your eyes open for modules that you already
worked-on and other people might be interested in. Find something,
clean it up, simplify it, document it and push it to GitHub. Then let
the world know about it on your blog / Twitter account / or related
mailing lists.

You could also pick a side-project to work on. To get some
inspiration:

- think of a problem that's bugging you and solve it;
- pick an open-source project that you'd like to work on and get paid
  for it, download the source-code, learn to use it and start
  contributing to it. You can start by fixing trivial bugs;
- if the above fail, think of something you'd really like working on,
  even if it is silly and even if it has no real world use;
  
### 3.3. Get Involved in a Community

Once you start being a good citizen, contributing by teaching others
to use a framework or by fixing bugs and so on, cultivate the
relationships with the other developers in that community.

You'll meet a lot of smart people on the way and that's going to be a
really good source of leads. Like, I once wrote a FreeSWITCH-related
tutorial for building a
[VoIP dialer](http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2009/02/20/tips-for-creating-voip-dialer.html),
submitted it on the mailing-list for reviews and I instantly got 2
collaboration offers.

My FreeSWITCH days are behind me, but judging in retrospect it was
damn easy to put my foot in the door.

## 4. Don't Settle for Shitty Jobs

Here are some questions you've got to ask yourself:

* are you working on cool stuff that gives you intellectual
  fulfillment, at least a couple of times per month?
* do you have real people that are using your work?
* ever get thank you notes from those people?
* are you paid accordingly to the value you bring?
* what's the reason behind your hiring? Was it because you're cheaper,
  or because finding your kind of talent is hard?

When I found my first remote job years ago, it happened by accident.

Here I was at my second job at a local software company, 8 months in,
let's call it X. This software company was contracted by another
consultancy company from New York, but with a twist - without any
feelings of compunction, X pretended to be an independent freelancer,
and I being put in charge of their project was paid with $600 per
month, while they cashed in $2000 per month from the New York company
(legally I was also paid the minimum wage, which was much lower, a
common scheme to avoid taxes).

So there I was, working on this project, until one day I found out
that this company's real reason for existence was money laundering
from a porn video chat.

I quit instantly, but I also told about it to the New York client I
was working for, which was weird because I said something like: *hey,
my name is not Bogdan, that's the pseudonym chosen by my company, my
name is Alex and I'm quiting*.

And I ended up working for them directly. The point of this story is
not to steal the clients of your current company. I had no intention
of doing that, but because I cared about the project I was working on,
I felt morally justified to let them know about this charade.

Also, this deal was actually not OK, because I ended up being
"managed" by an ass-hole, working on a shady contract. Also I almost
suffered from
[burnout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29),
until I finally quit in disgust, but on the other hand I learned a lot
from it and I hope I can pass to others some of this experience.

The one thing to take away from this: don't settle for shitty
companies and projects, even if the payment is good. Keep learning,
keep improving and trust your capabilities, as it will lead to
something much better.

You see, shitty jobs are carrier dead-ends. Not only is it
soul-sucking, but the longer you wait, the more you start indulging in
a soul-sucking activity that's being paid with peanuts.

## 5. Coping With The Downsides

### 5.1. Communication

This is the biggest problem from the perspective of your employer.

Working in a different timezone does have advantages, like having
enough quiet time to work, but it creates stress on both sides.

Because I'm anti-social, I've had my share of problems related to
this, but here are some things I've learned and that helped me:

* daily meetings and status reports are good, even if in a normal
  context these status reports are annoying as hell (i.e. for people
  that share the same office)
* do not get disconnected from your employer for more than a day; if
  you skipped a status report, make it a priority for the next day  
* be honest; I cannot stress this enough, as shit happens all the time
  (like you had a personal problem, or you had to pay your taxes, or
  you just weren't in the mood for working) ... and lying about it is
  the worst decision you could make  
* don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, don't be silent on
  roadblocks; as much as a no-brainer this is, beginners are always
  afraid of sounding stupid, therefore are afraid to communicate the
  problems they encounter, and it creates a vicious circle, as the
  longer you wait, the harder it gets to communicate your problems
* be there on time; if you've got a scheduled meeting at a certain
  hour, never be late   
* get a smartphone and always be online; but insist on asynchronous
  forms of communication (i.e. email) and on respecting working hours,
  the smartphone being just a channel for emergencies    
* never go silent; if you're contacted, then answer with at least an
  email that you're busy and you'll be available later or the next day
  
I know this is common-sense stuff, but it happens and it ain't pretty.

### 5.2. Have Money Saved for Emergencies

Technically you won't be an employer. You're going to be more like a
long-term contractor.

This means your agreement will be a lot more fragile, as firing a
contractor from another country is really easy and painless.

So have enough in the bank to survive for another 2-3 months in case
shit happens. It never happened to me, but I do have this constant
stress that it will happen, so it's important to have a cushion for
peace of mind.

### 5.3. Consider Renting an Office Space

A lot of people like working from home. Thus they avoid daily
commuting, or dressing properly on each day. It's kind of fun to
develop software while being naked and wearing your comfortable
slippers.

One problem is the lifestyle. It bores me to death, because I need
people to interact with, at least on my coffee/tea breaks. I find it
really healthy to get out of the house daily, meet other people and
have a daily routine.

I am also married and the proud father of a baby boy. I own my own
apartment, but it's kind of small, meaning that there's no way for me
to hide from the rest of my family while working. And because my wife
is in a different line of work than myself, as much as she tries, she
doesn't really understand that distractions are breaking my focus. Nor
does my toddler.

Therefore me and a colleague of mine have a rented office. Before this
I worked for almost 2 years out of a shared office space that was
perfect for freelancers and contractors. In some days I prefer coffee
shops. Other days I simply stay home when I'm in the mood, or when my
family needs me close.

Young people underestimate the importance of having an office. When
working from home, it gets really hard to separate work from home. It
means that when playing with your toddler or spending time with your
loved one, instead of enjoying the moment you'll be thinking about
work. Right now my daily routine is so solid that when I get home, I'm
home and work related issues simply disappear.

### 5.4. You'll Feel Stupid, But Don't Worry About It

Another problem is this nagging feeling that you're simply not good
enough. You're probably one of the best developers from your city, but
going remotely means you're going to meet a lot of smart people that
are simply better than you and sometimes cheaper too. 

Just don't fret about it. Make sure that you're constantly evolving
and everything else will be fine. The point of reference should always
be your own performance. Are you better than a month before? Have you
learned anything new? That's all that counts.

### 5.5. Live a Healthy Life

Here's some common sense advice that I've learned by not listening to
other people and doing every mistake I could ever do:

* make sure you have a life outside of software development
* make clear separations between work and home
* never, ever work overtime or on weekends, unless for emergencies
  (and btw, emergencies should be exceptions, not the rule)
* eat healthy food (lots of green vegetables, lots of dairy products,
  stay away from fast food, starchy foods or sweets)
* don't be a couch potato, go out and exercise

Until now I've broken every rule from the above list, so I've been
there and trust me, burnout and depression is just around the corner
if you ignore these warnings.
