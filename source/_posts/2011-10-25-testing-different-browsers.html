  I got a notice that my <a
  href="https://github.com/alexandru/crossdomain-requests-js"
  target="blank_">crossdomain-requests-js script</a> (described in
  length <a
  href="/blog/2011/03/24/cross-domain-requests.html">here</a>)
  does not work on IExplorer 9.
</p>

<p>
  God, how much I hate dealing with browsers. Initially when I wrote
  that script I tested on IExplorer 6 and IExplorer 8. I already had
  to deal with issues regarding the IExplorer 8 compatibility mode. I
  already had taken the decision to completely ignore IExplorer 7, as
  that was a fucked up release. Either way, it is possible that I
  completely wrecked IExplorer support with later changes that I
  failed to retest.
</p>

<p>
  And all of this for a 233 lines script (including comments and
  whitespace). How fucked up is that?
</p>

<p>
  This is also why I love JQuery so much. Unfortunately if you want to
  publish a <i>reusable</i> library it's extremely annoying to bring a
  dependency such as JQuery with it. Even though JQuery is popular,
  the latest release is a whooping 90K in size. Do you know how
  painful that is on mobile browsers? NO, infrastructure code has to
  be done for the lowest common denominator: that's why people still
  do complex shit in C. C is portable and you can link to C from any
  other library.
</p>

<p>
  Either way, I might do a rewrite in CoffeeScript: at least that's
  going to save me the pain of dealing with syntax differences, as
  I've been having those kinds of problems too ;-)
</p>

<h2>So what to do?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    prefer CoffeeScript for development, not because it is cool but
    because it is sane
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft was kind enough to release virtual-machine images for
    testing your websites in various IExplorer versions - I'm
    installing them in VirtualBox right now using this script here: <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">https://github.com/xdissent/ievms</a>
    (many thanks to the author, I'll let you know how it goes)
  </li>
  <li>
    Always test with the 6 biggies: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, IExplorer
    6, IExplorer 8 (watch out for the compatibility mode) and
    IExplorer 9
  </li>
  <li>
    There are few differences between Chrome and Safari, both being
    based on WebKit and V8 is pretty compatible with Safari's JS
    Engine, so I don't bother with it. But it doesn't hurt if you have
    it around.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mobile Safari and Android's browser are <i>different</i> from
    desktop Safari and Chrome. Do not assume that your shit will
    automatically work on mobiles.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Do me a small favor ...</h2>

<p>
  Open this page: <a href="/projects/crossdomain-requests-js/"
  target="_blank">http://bionicspirit.com/projects/crossdomain-requests-js/</a>
</p>

<p>
  Then tell me if it works or not in your browser, including the
  browser name and version you are using. You can use the comments
  section below, or in <a href="http://bit.ly/sA07lI"
