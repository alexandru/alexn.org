I've merged 2 domain names: [alexn.org](http://alexn.org) and
[bionicspirit.com](http://bionicspirit.com); and so I'm teaching you
how to do it.

I wanted the later to be a more focused blog, however I'm a software
developer, not an "*X developer*". Focusing on single technologies is
boring and not really my style. However, I am focused on excellence
and that's going to be the focus of my unified blog:

* DIY techniques;
* Personal development;
* The basics: algorithms, server admin, design, ux;
* Lessons from my life as a software developer, with an
  entrepreneurial mindset, that works remotely and is a father of a
  baby boy :-)
  
So apologies for any inconvenience generated. Old content is not lost.

## Personal Reasons for bionicspirit.com

I'm migrating [alexn.org](http://alexn.org) to
[bionicspirit.com](http://bionicspirit.com) and not the other way
around.

* it can be pronounced without spelling, even in my native language;
* it is easier to remember;
* it can become a brand that transcends my own name;

However, if I don't get this right, I'm going to be penalized by
Google and by my subscribers. It is also not an action that can be
easily reverted. I also can't get rid of the old domain, for all
eternity, as links to it are already spread throughout the web. But
that's fine, I'll just make it a simple profile page.

## First Step: Have a Checklist

It's very easy to forget about small details. So it's really smart to
have a TODO list ready:

* migrate articles;
* migrate feed link;
* all links from the old website must still be functional (with a
  redirect);
* migrate supporting services: Google Analytics, Disqus, FeedBurner,
  etc...

Then make a battle plan. Try and identify the problems that you may
come up against. For example: 

* It's best if a single step from the above doesn't disrupt anything
  (googlebot, feed readers, external links). So in what sequence do
  you execute?  
* Can Disqus merge 2 accounts? If not, can you do a manual merge?
* How can 2 FeedBurner accounts be merged? 
* Do you have conflicting content? 
* Do you have garbage that you'd like to get rid of?

Check this list before, after and during the process. Double-check
that all tasks have been completed and are working properly. Never
leave behind broken links.
