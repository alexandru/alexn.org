<h2>Note (Feb 17, 2011)</h2> 

<p>
  This article was written when working for my former employer, <a
  href="http://sinapticode.ro" target="_blank">Sinapticode</a>.  They
  are great consultants. You wouldn't go wrong for contacting them on
  FreeSWITCH-related consulting.
</p>

<p>
  This article also refers to FreeSWITCH Revision 10694.  Things could
  have changed since then, there might be better ways for doing what's
  described in this article; ask on their mailing list.
</p>
 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
<p>We are trying to migrate one of our existing Asterisk setups to
FreeSWITCH. These are some tips to walk you thorough the hard part of
learning the inners of FreeSWITCH for creating a simple dialer.</p> 
 
<p>As you will learn, FreeSWITCH is a little overwhelming, while being
flexible and easy to use.</p> 
 
<p>Being a software developer, I prefer the flexibility of a
programming language, rather than working with XML configuration
files. Fortunately the standard FreeSWITCH distribution comes with
both a SpiderMonkey engine (javascript) and Lua embeded. And it works
great for our needs.</p> 
 
<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Our setup is based on Debian Linux. You should have no problem
  following it for other Linux-distros or operating systems though.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  For external scripts, we prefer Perl, and I'll give a code sample
  using it, but I don't think it would be a problem porting it to the
  language of your choice.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  You'll also need
  a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a> 
  provider for initiating external VoIP calls.
</p> 
 
<h2>Step 1: Instalation</h2> 
 
<p>You can find detailed installation instructions here: 
<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Installation_Guide">http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Installation_Guide</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Our setups are based on Debian, and there are also instructions
for <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Installation_Guide#Debian_Linux">building
Debian packages</a>.</p> 
 
<p>If you build Debian packages, the default instalation path is
/opt/freeswitch (revision 10694). You can change that by modifying
debian/rules in the sources directory (search for /opt/freeswitch,
you'll find a "./configure" section), once you download it. But this
tutorial is based on the default settings.</p> 
 
<h2>Step 2: Configuration</h2> 
 
<p> 
  I won't dwell on details since the configuration can be a painful
  process, and you would be better served contacting
  the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Main_Page#Community_and_Support">FreeSWITCH
    community</a>.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  But you'll probably need to configure authentication settings for your
  SIP provider. To do that, look at the lead on the
  wiki: <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Getting_Started_Guide#External">external
    SIP profiles</a>.
 
  For us it was easy since our provider doesn't require user/password
  authentication, and no extra configuration was necessary.
</p> 
 
<h2>Step 3: Initiating External Calls</h2> 
 
<p> 
  In case the FreeSWITCH daemon has started, you need to stop it for now ...
 
  {% highlight bash %}/etc/init.d/freeswitch stop{% endhighlight %}
 
  If you also have Asterisk up and runnings, you should stop it also, to
  avoid any conflicts.
</p> 
 
<p>
  Then open the FreeSWITCH console:
  {% highlight bash %}/opt/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch -c {% endhighlight %}
</p> 
 
<p> 
  Calls can be initiated by using
  the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_commands#originate">originate
    command</a>. You'll need a "call url" with the syntax described on the
  wiki: <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Sofia#Syntax">Sofia#Syntax</a>.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  To make a simple call, let's setup a simple dialplan. Also, let's also
  play a simple audio file,
  according <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Playing_recording_external_media#Play_wav">to
    the wiki example</a>.To do that, create a dialplan extension by
  creating a file
  named <i>/opt/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/default/2009_play.xml</i> with
  the following text:

{% highlight xml %}
<include> 
  <extension name="wavs"> 
 
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^2009$"> 
      <action application="sleep" data="2000"/> 
      <action application="playback" data="/path/to/your.wav"/> 
    </condition> 
 
  </extension> 
</include>{% endhighlight %}
 
    The file is self-descriptive. When the phone is answered, it waits 2
    seconds before playing your audio file of choice.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  Now, in the Free console execute the following command (while
  providing a real number and your own SIP provider, of course):

  {% highlight bash %}originate sofia/external/$number@$myprovider.com 2009 {% endhighlight %}

  If everything goes well (the phone rings, and you can hear the audion
  file), then <b>congratulations</b>, you're well on your way :)
</p> 
 
<h2>Step 4: Scripting</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Freeswitch comes with Spidermonkey, and Lua embedded, and also
  offers integration with other languages, like Python and Perl. I'm
  going to exemplify Javascript, because it's a decent mainstream
  language that I like, but if you're worried about performance or you
  just want to have some fun, you should give Lua a try.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  I also really, really hate XML configuration files. So I wanted to
  do everything from a script file, with these reasons on top of my
  head:
  <ol>  
    <li>general-purpose scripting languages make me happy</li> 
    <li> 
      you gain flexibility ... and stuff like retrying the call
      based on certain conditions, or a finite state automata depending
      on the client/campaign ... easy as pie
    </li> 
    <li>have I mentioned that I hate XML?</li> 
  </ol> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
  In your favorite text editor, create a file "voice.js", with the
  following code:

{% highlight javascript %}
session = new Session('sofia/external/$number@provider');
// The following line is a deprecated method 
// session.originate(undefined, 'sofia/external/$number@provider'); 

session.waitForAnswer(10000);
 
if (session.ready()) { 
    session.sleep(1000);
    session.streamFile('/path/to/your.wav');
}
{% endhighlight %}
 
  See:
  <ul> 
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Session_waitForAnswer">waitForAnswer</a></li> 
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Session_streamFile">streamFile</a></li> 
  </ul> 
 
  For our purposes, this snippet is almost equivalent to our initial
  dialplan extension.  To execute it, in the FreeSWITCH console run
  the following command:

  {% highlight bash %}jsrun /path/to/voice.js{% endhighlight %}
</p> 
 
<h2>Step 5: More Scripting</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Now that we've got working code, lets expand it a little to make it
  more useful.
</p> 
 
<h2>How to send a caller-id when initiating calls?</h2> 
 
<p> 
  We want the call to have an associated caller-ID.  The caller-ID is
  passed by setting the channel variables
  <i>origination_caller_id_number</i> and
  <i>origination_caller_id_name</i>. Try it in a FreeSWITCH console
  right now by executing this command:
</p> 

{% highlight bash %}
originate {origination_caller_id_number=123456, \
           ignore_early_media=true}sofia/external/$number@provider &{% endhighlight %}
 
Or in your script:

{% highlight javascript %}
var session = new Session("{origination_caller_id_number=1234567}"
                          + "sofia/external/$number@provider");{% endhighlight %}
 
<p> 
  For the B-leg of a bridged connection, you either set
  <i>origination_caller_id_(name/number)</i> on the new connection,
  or, as a shortcut, on the A-leg you can specify the channel
  variables <i>effective_caller_id_number</i> and
  <i>effective_caller_id_name</i> which are passed to any B-leg call
  initiated. Try it in a console:
</p>
 
{% highlight bash %}
originate {origination_caller_id_number=1111111111, \
           effective_caller_id_number=222222222, \
           ignore_early_media=true}sofia/external/$number@provider \
           &bridge(sofia/external/$second_number@provider){% endhighlight %}

<h2>How to retry if phone is busy?</h2> 
 
</p><p> 
  We want to retry the call immediately after, maybe the client
  pressed the wrong button and rejected the call.  As in this 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Busy_Call_Retry">wiki
  page</a>, but with a twist: we wouldn't want to retry more than
  once, because annoyed customers are not happy customers.

{% highlight javascript %}
function makeCall(nr_or_tries) { 
    session = new Session('sofia/external/$number@provider');
    // The following line is a deprecated method 
    //session.originate(undefined, 'sofia/external/$number@provider'); 
 
    session.waitForAnswer(10000);
 
    if (session.cause == "USER_BUSY") { 
        // not sure if this is necessary 
	// session.hangup(); 
 
	if (nr_or_tries <= 1) { 
	    console_log("Action: Trying again!");
	    return true;
	} 
 
	console_log("Action: Cannot try again, skipping!");
    } 
 
 
    if (session.ready()) { 
        session.sleep(1000);
	session.streamFile('/path/to/your.wav');
	session.hangup();
    } 
} 
 
var nr_or_tries = 0;
 
while (nr_or_tries < 2) { 
    if (!makeCall(nr_or_tries++)) break;
}{% endhighlight %}
 
  See: <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Session_hangup">hangup</a>.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  Of course, this script retries the call immediately.  This may not
  be what you want (you may want to wait 10 minutes for a retry), so
  our favorite way for retries is through an external script that
  handles the calls queue.
 
</p> 
 
<h2>How to detect phone keys pressed?</h2> 
 
<p>Now we're getting somewhere :)</p> 
 
<p> 
  The first thing you have to do, after the originate command, is
  activating <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc._Dialplan_Tools_start_dtmf">DTFM
  detection</a>. This can be done in an extension configuration file,
  but I prefer doing it from our script, for reasons stated above. So
  after you execute the <i>originate</i> command, you have to execute
  the following:
 
  {% highlight javascript %}session.execute("start_dtmf");{% endhighlight %}
</p> 
 
<p> 
  Now, when you play an audio file, the <i>streamFile</i> function
  accepts as parameter an event handler, which can be used to detect
  keys pressed. So, lets say than when you press "1", you want to
  repeat your message, and when you press "2", you want to play
  another audio file:

{% highlight javascript %}
var session = new Session(/*... params ... */);
// The following line is a deprecated method 
//session.originate(/*... params ... */); 
session.execute("start_dtmf");
 
var on_event = function ( session, type, data, arg ) { 
 
    // we are only concerned with "dtmf" event types 
    if (type != "dtmf") return;
 
    if (data.digit == "1") { 
        return "seek:0";
    } 
    else if (data.digit == "2") { 
 
        session.sleep(1000);
	session.streamFile("/path/to/another.wav");
 
	/* current audio file is stopped
	* on returning false
	*/ 
	return false;
    }

 
    /* for any other key pressed
    * returning true keeps the current audio playing
    */ 
    return true;
};
 
if (session.ready()) { 
    session.sleep(2000);
    session.streamFile("/path/to/your.wav", on_event);
}{% endhighlight %}
 
  <b>Note:</b> minutes cost money, so you should add a counter to
  limit the maximum times a message can be replayed. There are many
  weirdos out there ;)
</p> 
 
<h2>How to create a connection between your session and another phone?</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Maybe you want your client to be connected to a real operator (when
  he's pressing "0" on his phone keyboard maybe?). It's easy, here's
  how:

{% highlight javascript %}
// the original session 
session = new Session('sofia/external/$number@provider');
// The following line is a deprecated method 
// session.originate(undefined, 'sofia/external/$number@provider'); 

session.answer();

if (session.ready()) { 
    var new_session = new Session('sofia/external/$another_number>@provider');
    // The following line is a deprecated method 
    //new_session.originate(session, 'sofia/external/$another_number@provider'); 
    new_session.answer();
    
    if (new_session.ready()) { 
        bridge(session, new_session);
    } 
}{% endhighlight %}
 
  See: <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_commands#bridge">bridge</a>.  
  If you want to add the actual key-press event, see the example above.
</p> 
 
<h2>How to execute external commands from your script?</h2> 
 
<p> 
  If you want to execute an external script (like for sending a
  notification when a certain event happens), you can use
  the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Javascript_Misc_system">system</a> 
  command.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  If you want to execute an external command, and process its output,
  you can open a pipe using
  the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/File">File</a> object.
 
  In FreeSWITCH you do have the possibility of accessing a database
  using ODBC, but I haven't tried it, and in case it doesn't work, you
  can always write an external script that does the processing you
  need, and then returns a JSON, or an XML file.
</p> 
 
 
<h2>Step 6: Communicating with FreeSWITCH using mod_event_socket</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Playing in the FreeSWITCH console is fun, but what you need is a
  server who receives notifications from an external script.
</p> 
 
<p> 
  First, shut down the FreeSWITCH console, and start FS in daemon mode.
 
  {% highlight bash %}/etc/init.d/freeswitch start {% endhighlight %}
 
  Next, copy your work thus far (which I assume it's located
  in <i>dialer.js</i>) to <u>/opt/freeswitch/scripts</u>. That's where
  scripts are usually deployed in FreeSWITCH.
</p> 
 
<p>  
  FreeSWITCH can communicate
  through <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_event_socket">mod_event_socket</a>.
  You can communicate using a simple telnet connection, but I'm lazy,
  and <a target="_blank" href="http://search.cpan.org/~jrogers/Net-Telnet-3.03/lib/Net/Telnet.pm">Net::Telnet</a> 
  is complaining about a missing login prompt.
 
  Luckily, in the FreeSWITCH sources directory, you'll find a
  sample <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_event_socket#perl_command_client">perl
  command client</a>. The source code is located
  in <u><i>freeswitch_src</i>/scripts/socket</u> and in there
  you'll find the perl package <i>FreeSWITCH::Client</i>. Copy it to your
  project's location, and create a script called <u>dialer.pl</u> with
  the following code:
 
{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/perl 
use strict;
use warnings;

# make sure it's located in your @USE paths 
use FreeSWITCH::Client;

my $fs = init FreeSWITCH::Client {-password => 'ClueCon'} or die "Error: $@";

# shows number of active channels ... 
# useful when you want to control the maximum number of 
# calls made simultaneously 

$reply = $fs->command("show channels");
print "Channels\n------------\n$reply\n";

# calls our script, that initiates a call 
# the command is non-blocking, so you can make multiple 
# calls in parallel 

$fs->command("jsrun dialer.js");

$fs->disconnect();{% endhighlight %}
 
  Btw, if you're not feeling comfortable about communicating through
  plain-old sockets with FreeSWITCH,
  try <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_http">mod_http</a>.
</p> 
 
<h2>Wrapping up</h2> 
 
<p> 
  Congratulations, you've made it to the end. You just need to add
  you're specific business logic, and you already have a kick-ass
  dialer.
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
  There are lots of scenarios not addressed by this tutorial. One need
  you might have would be to get the logs of your calls, and see what
  customers haven't answered, what customers pressed what key, the
  average duration of a call, and other such niceties.
 
  Since this is a big topic to talk about, and since I still have some
  research to do, this deserves a whole new article.
</p>
