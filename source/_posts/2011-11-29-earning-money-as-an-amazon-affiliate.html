  I published an article that I've meant to publish for a long
  time. I'm usually lazy to not bother writing many articles, however
  this time I also thought about doing an experiment - you see I'm (1)
  on a tight budget and (2) a cheap bastard - so what if I could get
  enough money to pay for my monthly hosting on Linode, while
  satisfying my urge to write from time to time? 
</p>

<p>
  As such I included Amazon Affiliate links in that post to see what
  happens.

<h2>UPDATE: Moral Considerations Against Amazon's Associates</h2>

<p>
  The discussion on <a
  href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3291167"
  target="_blank">Hacker News</a> took an interesting turn. A couple
  of comments are a little unbalanced, however there's <a
  href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3292508" target="_blank">a
  comment</a> that I like and with which I am in agreement:
</p>

<p class="dialog">
  <i>
    Having affiliate links creates incentives that may not align with
    faithfully serving your readers. It does not automatically bias your
    writing, but it can certainly create the appearance of bias.
  </i>
  <br /> <br />
  <i>
    A concrete example would be writing an especially glowing review
    of the new Kindle because you have a vested stake in people buying
    them. Or, perhaps, NOT writing a glowing review because you fear
    it will be perceived as shilling for affiliate cash.
  </i>
  <br /> <br />
  <i>
    In fact On The Media recently did a story about the Washington
    Post struggling with whether or not to include Amazon affiliate
    links in its book reviews. I think it presents both sides of the
    argument: <a

    target="_blank">www.onthemedia.org/2011/nov/11/web-links...</a>
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  This comment is striking, as when I started fantasizing about where
  should I go from here, the one thing that crossed my mind was that I
  could write a review for the Kindle (I own one) - and oops, 
  unfortunately in that instance my actual opinion would have been
  <i>unfaithful</i> - <a href="http://www.elidickinson.com/"
  target='_blank'>@esd</a> nailed it.
</p>

<p>
  Also, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3292777">a
  reply</a> puts the above in balance:
</p>

<p class="dialog">
  <i>
    Newspapers likely disallow such practices in order to maintain
    journalistic integrity, but a blog author who is writing posts on
    purpose to sell things is probably not interested in maintaining
    journalistic integrity. The blog author is just interested in
    selling stuff. Maybe the blog posts are well-written and
    interesting, or maybe they are not. If they are not, then readers
    who care principally about content will likely avoid the blog on the
    lack of merit of the content itself.
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  (the quality of Hacker News still amazes me)
</p>

<p>
  In my oppinion, putting affiliate links is not bad or evil per se -
  for instance you could say that customers of Apple or Google have an
  inherent bias because they feel the need to protect their monetary
  and/or emotional investment. And we aren't professional journalists,
  trained to watch out for such things - but a mistake is a
  mistake. So from now on, no more Amazon-related reviews coming from
  me (maybe I'll try clearly delimited boxes or something).
</p>

<h2>Some Facts and Stats</h2>

<p>
  The article I'm talking about:
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog/2011/11/25/4-books-for-learning-to-design-the-hard-way.html">4 Books for Learning to Design, the Hard Way</a>
</p>

<p>
  I published this article on the 25th, <i>The Black Friday</i> - so
  it had perfect timing. Then I pushed this link to Hacker News and
  Reddit. I hope you will forgive me, since this was a little
  self-promotion and I don't deny it, however I hope you found the
  content therein to be worth it, as it was published with my best
  intentions.
</p>

<p>
  The resulting traffic and the fee that Amazon gives for the orders
  generated took me by surprise. Here's how my traffic looks like
  (unique visitors):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nov 24: 45</li>
  <li>Nov 25: 10,263</li>
  <li>Nov 26: 6,939</li>
  <li>Nov 27: 1,713</li>
  <li>Nov 28: 1,299</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Wow. I never generated this much traffic with my blog. Also, here's
  the Amazon stats (updated for Nov 28th):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ordered items: 333</li>
  <li>Clicks: 6,259</li>
  <li>Conversion: 5.32%</li>
  <li>Total items shipped: 294</li>
  <li>Total earnings: $367.10</li>
</ul>

<p>
  So considering that not all items have been shipped and this ain't
  over yet (I'm still getting traffic), we're looking at:
</p>

<p class="dialog">
  a half-an-hour effort for a single article, earning <b>$400</b>, in
  4 days, on a very low-traffic personal blog
</p>

<p>
  My goal was achieved too - I now have enough money for ~20 months of
  hosting on Linode. Thank you dear readers, I am in your debt.
</p>

<h2>Amazon Associates versus Google AdSense</h2>

<p>
  <i>Google AdSense</i> rewards are <i>per-click</i> and is the first
  option of many webmasters, because it does generate more
  money. However I feel that the overall user experience suffers a lot
  - the links served may be context-dependent, but the quality is poor.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Amazon Associates</i> rewards are instead <i>per-action</i>. When
  the user buys something, you get a referral fee. This can work very
  well because the items displayed are hand-picked by you and the
  links add value to your content - whenever I search for reviews of
  individuals (which I trust more than those of experts), my first
  stop is on Amazon.
</p>

<h2>Why A Single Flower Doesn't Bring Spring</h2>

<p>
  So whenever anybody does this successfully, the appetite only grows
  bigger. After all, this kind of revenue has the potential of being
  passive. However don't get your hopes up:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    in this instance, the timing was perfect and so the circumstances
    can't be reproduced every month
  </li>
  <li>
    to have constant conversions you need a big and loyal following
    that trusts your recommendations
  </li>
  <li>
    to have a big and loyal following, you also need lots of traffic
    driven by search engines 
  </li>
  <li>
    to score well in search engines, you need lots of articles with
    lots of keywords and good ranking
  </li>
  <li>
    to have loyal readers and a good ranking on Google, those articles
    must be high-quality
  </li>
  <li>
    it takes lots and lots of work for the above, probably 1 or 2
    years, considering you have the talent of writing content already,
    or the money to hire people to do it
  </li>
  <li>
    if you can't recommend anything else other than books, then you're
    screwed, as you don't have the time to read so many
  </li>
  <li>
    if the products getting recommended are not relevant to your
    audience, then they won't convert
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So there you have it. My experiment with Amazon's Associates, while
  probably a short one, has brought joy in my heart :)
</p>

<p>
  Thank you,
</p>
