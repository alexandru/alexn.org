Starting out learning Android development may be intimidating at
first, as with any new platform of reasonable complexity you'll have
a lot to learn. However the learning process is fun. So here are
some learning resources that I'm currently following.

## Books for Learning Android

My problem with books is that technical books get obsolete really
fast. Books from 2010, while still useful, are already insufficient
now with the release of Ice Cream Sandwich. The upside is that there
are a lot of books out there.

For ~ $40 you can buy a 1-year subscription for
[CommonsWare.com](http://commonsware.com). The author, Mark Murphy, is
a very proficient Android developer, trainer and consultant, with a
huge
[StackOverflow reputation](http://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware)
:) More seriously - for $40 you get 3 books that are continuously
updated, which is great.

Here are the books (but don't buy them from Amazon, as you won't get
the 1-year subscription, which is the main reason I'm recommending
these):

* <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098167805X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bionicspirit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=098167805X">The Busy Coder's Guide to Advanced Android Development</a> 
* <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981678041/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bionicspirit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0981678041">Android Programming Tutorials</a>

[{% img right /assets/photos/prag_hello_android.jpg 150 Hello Android (3rd edition)  %}](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356565/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bionicspirit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356565)

Again, don't buy these items from Amazon. Buy them with the 1-year
subscription from the [Author's Website](http://commonsware.com) (I
did so myself and btw, I have no affiliation with the author). The
subscription is useful because you'll get upgrades for new versions of
Android and bug-fixes, for a whole year.

Another book I've been reading is 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356565/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bionicspirit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356565">Hello Android</a> 
by [Ed Burnette](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette), published by the
[Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/book/eband3/hello-android). 
It's pretty good, but it is more of an introduction (truly a Hello
World).

Other books I have not tried, so my list stops here, but updates will
follow.


## Free Stuff Available Online


I'm the kind of developer that prefers to rely on freely available
stuff, because I learn by doing and technical books on APIs are
boring. Plus, I like free stuff, however if you plan on getting
serious about it, then a small investment is worth it and will keep
you focused (nothing will keep you more focused than spending some
money).

* [Tutorials, by Android Developers](http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=tutorial)
* [Articles, by Android Developers](http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=article)

The official beginner tutorials are not so comprehensive, however
you'll get a lot of value from reading the Articles. Lots of value
in there, which works best if used in conjunction with the samples
provided:

* [Samples, by Android Developers](http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=sample)

Seriously, you won't find a faster learning path than reading and
understanding the source-code of real apps. However to not attempt
doing this without going through some of the tutorials in the link
above.

* [Videos from Google I/O](http://developer.android.com/videos/index.html#v=twmuBbC_oB8)
* [The Official Dev Guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/index.html)

The videos from Google I/O are a gold mine, providing insight you
won't find anywhere else. Highly recommended. All in all, the
official documentation is good, although lacking beginner
friendliness and a structured clear path. Plus I noticed it has
holes in it, but you'll be fine.

For asking questions, or browse around for insightful gems, there's
nothing better than:

* [The Android tag on StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android).

At the time of this writing, I don't have many Android-related
blogs to share with you and the ones I know about are of poor
quality - apparently not many people blog about their Android
experience. Hopefully this will change for the better.

Please help me out in identifying other resources! Thanks!
