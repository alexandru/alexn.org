Inspired by the [Digital
Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) book, by Cal
Newport, I've been inspired to change my philosophy and habits regarding the
use of technology.

I'm doing this because it felt like the use of online services, driven by my
smartphone, has been consuming me. I might say that I'm a smartphone or an
online addict, craving shallow online socializing over meaningful face to face
conversations, and wasting time on social media, over productive work. The
pandemic has made things worse.
