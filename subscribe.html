  <h2>RSS Web Feed</h2>

  <p>
    An alternative to the email newsletter is following the website's RSS feed.
    You can do this with various applications, that run both locally or online,
    out of which the recommended ones would be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://newsblur.com/" target="_blank">Newsblur</a> (web, open-source)</li>
    <li><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> (web, open-source, self-hosted)</li>
    <li><a href="https://feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly (web)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> (MacOS, iOS)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The website can simply be added, or in case of issues you can use the following link:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="{{ site.feed }}" target="_blank">{{ site.feed }}</a>
  </p>
</div>
