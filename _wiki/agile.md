## Kanban

[Eric Brechner: "Agile Project Management with Kanban"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0y-aU1sXo)

Notes:

- WIP - limit number of tickets equal to number of people, with some buffer 
- Unlimited in scope as far as time goes
- Tasks should be limited to be smaller in size
- Example board:
  - Backlog
  - Breakdown
  - Implement
  - Validate
- Each column has an "in progress" and "done" sub-columns
