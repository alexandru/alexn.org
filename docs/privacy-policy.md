<p class="intro withcap">
  This website does not collect personally identifiable information, and no cookies are installed that could be used to track visitors.
</p>

This website has a strict no-cookies policy. Third-parties used for providing the service may drop cookies; however, the implementation goes to great lengths to prevent that.

## Analytics

This website uses a self-hosted (first-party) [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) instance for tracking users' visits, with these characteristics:

1. no tracking cookies are being set
2. no tracking cookies will be created in the future without explicit permission
3. IPs are anonymized
4. collected data is used by the website's owner for content optimizations, in full compliance of GDPR, and is never shared with third-party services

If you wish to disable these analytics, you can enable the [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"} header. See how to enable it in:

- [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}

<p class="warn-bubble" markdown="1">
  **WARN:** This header is not supported in Safari, as Apple pulled support for it. This is because, at the moment of writing, the header isn't legally binding, and it might aid in fingerprinting. This might change in the future with the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"} initiative.

## Commenting

This `alexn.org` website uses a self-hosted [Isso commenting](https://posativ.org/isso/){:target="_blank"} server and widget, for allowing comments on articles.

The commenting widget collects your name, email, and website. Your email is for being notified in case of replies (optional feature), or for being contacted by the author, but only related to your comments. Your website is optionally collected in case you want to show to other readers who you are. This data, collected via the commenting widget, is only used for displaying and reacting to comments on the website. It will not be used for any other purpose, or given to any third-party.

## Email Newsletter

The `alexn.org` website uses [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}. Email addresses collected via the newsletter subscription are processed by Mailchimp, acting as a data processor.

The collected email addresses are used solely to deliver notifications on new articles being published.

Read [Mailchimp's Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/#3._Privacy_for_Contacts){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}.

## Cloudflare

The `alexn.org` website uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"} as a proxy for caching content, and protecting against DDoS attacks.

Cloudflare sets a cookie named `__cfduid` that's [restricted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Restrict_access_to_cookies){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"} with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes, meaning that it is secure, and other parties cannot access it. Cloudflare can identify users via this cookie, but they consider it a technical cookie that's "*strictly necessary to provide the service*" (see [Understanding the Cloudflare Cookies](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}). We cannot opt-out of this cookie, all websites being served through Cloudflare have it.

## Video Players

Some embedded third-party services might drop cookies (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo players); however, the website's implementation activates "do not track" options whenever possible.

- Read [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"}; note this website uses `youtube-nocookie.com` for activating YouTube's "privacy-enhanced mode," see [embedding options](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"}
- Read [Vimeo's Privacy Policy](https://vimeo.com/privacy){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"}; note the website [embeds the player](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001494447-Using-Player-Parameters){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"} with a `dnt=1` flag that deactivates session cookies and tracking
