## Cookies

Some scripts might use cookies for delivering a good experience. For learning more about what cookies are, see: [cookiesandyou.com](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/){:target="_blank",rel="nofollow"}.

Cookies might be installed on this domain via:

- Google Analytics is configured to use `_gaAlexNOrg`, a cookie meant for identifying the user â€” configured with a limited maximum age and a custom name in order to not be collected by other scripts that may be running on the page
- Mailchimp's script may also drop cookies meant for delivering functionality strictly related to newsletter subscriptions
- Video players, YouTube/Vimeo, may drop cookies, although this website is working hard to load such players with "do not track" and "no cookies" options turned on
