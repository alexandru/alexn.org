  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #412222;">
    Status: Not looking for work / taken and perfectly happy!
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a full stack developer capable of handling everything, from
    back-end development and administering systems, to front-end
    design and user experience. I'm experienced in a wide range of
    cutting-edge technologies and problem domains, emphasizing on
    better algorithms, quality and user experience. Since I worked as
    a consultant, I've had the pleasure of talking to real people,
    understanding and solving real world problems. I've worked in 2
    startups, but also experienced the corporate environment of a
    multi-national company. I've had happy clients and happy
    coworkers. I get shit done.
  </p>

  <p>
    I tend to gravitate towards data crawling / mining / user
    profiling, but I like working on anything interesting and that has
    a positive impact on people.
