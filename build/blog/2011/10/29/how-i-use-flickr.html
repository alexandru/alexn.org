  <h1>How I Use Flickr: For Backup</h1>
  <div class="post-date">29 Oct 2011</div>

  <p>
  I've got a growing number of personal pictures and the collection is
  growing since 2003, when I got my first digital camera, a shitty
  Sanyo that still works and that I still use whenever I forget about
  my Nikon.
</p>

<p>
  But here's the thing with digital pictures - <i><b>they are cheap to
  make, but also easy to lose</b></i>. Digital storage is not as
  reliable as glossy paper. Pictures printed on paper can easily last
  for a 100 years. That's not the case with any digital storage medium
  and we will suffer for it.
</p>

<h2>Storing My Pictures In The Cloud</h2>

<p>
  Pro accounts on Flickr have unlimited storage and can upload and
  access full-resolution pictures. This is great, although be careful
  about believing in "unlimited plans", as nothing is really unlimited
  and by abusing Flickr you may find yourself locked out of your
  account.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately the tools for uploading really suck and I haven't
  encountered yet a graphical interface that did what I needed. So for
  synchronizing, I've built my own script in Ruby using the excelent
  <a href="http://hanklords.github.com/flickraw/">Flickraw gem</a> and
  <a href="http://exifr.rubyforge.org/">exifr</a>, another Ruby gem
  that reads Exif headers from Jpeg files.
</p>

<p>
  One common problem is that you ALWAYS have duplicates. And you don't
  want to upload duplicates. What you really want is an "<i>rsync</i>"
  command for Flickr. But how do you know if a picture was already
  uploaded?
</p>

<p>
  The approach I'm using is to add a <a
  href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/"
  target="_blank">machine tag</a> to my pictures, which is set like a
  tag, but has the format "namespace:key=value". This machine tag
  represents the MD5 hash of the picture and if you want to see if a
  certain photo was already uploaded to flickr, you can always <a
  href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html"
  target="_blank">search for it</a>. Here's how it looks on one of my
  pictures:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">checksum:md5<span class="o">=</span>5b2fa91c38a7f878088e1420b924e6d9
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>
  Besides this, I have this problem with some of the older photos
  taken by my Sanyo, where the taken-date is totally fucked and for
  personal photos the taken date is maybe more important than the
  actual photo quality. I use the excelent <a
  href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a> to
  correct those photos. It's nice building on the hard work of other
  people ;)
</p>

<p>
  So, currently I have 3545 pictures uploaded on Flickr in full
  resolution and the number will more than triple as soon as I make an
  inventory of my pictures stored on old hardware I've got lying
  around.
</p>

<p>
  It is fun being a developer. I can make shit happen.
</p>

<h2>Flickr is Not A Reliable Backup</h2>

<p>
  Flickr is an online service that isn't meant for being a backup. I
  share only a fraction of what I upload, everything else is <i>family
  only</i>. They may terminate your account at any time for whatever
  reason. They may also go out of business. Yahoo may sell it, etc,
  etc... I do think Flickr is awesome btw and one reason that I store
  my photos on Flickr is to be able to always have the whole archive
  with me. But for backup alone, that's not enough.
</p>

<p>
  What you really need to do is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    your main repository should be stored locally and properly
    maintained - I do that on my main computer currently, but multi-TB
    external hard-drives are cheap
  </li>
  <li>
    in case of cloud backup, you always need a secondary service for
    redundancy
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Google's Picasa is a good option because you can explicitly buy
  storage. This means that if you pay for 80 GB of storage nobody is
  going to get upset that you uploaded 80 GB of private photos
  ... also, if your photo collection matters to you, I wouldn't put my
  trust in their Google+ offering (photos of up to 2048x2048 pixels do
  not count towards your free quota). That's because that offer is not
  meant for you. Just pay up.
</p>

<p>
  So on Google's Picasa, I'm currently working on integrating with
  their API too. The desktop app is nice, but too limited for me.
</p>
