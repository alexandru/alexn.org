  <h1>UX Tip: Don't Make Me Curse The Day I Decided To Sign-Up</h1>
  <div class="post-date">16 Dec 2011</div>

  <p>To illustrate the shit I was talking about in
<a href="/blog/2011/12/12/ux-tip-outside-us-dont-require-postal-codes.html">Outside the US, Don't Require Postal Codes</a>,
here's a concrete example: <strong>DZone.com</strong></p>

<p><img src="//media.bionicspirit.com/assets/photos/dzone.png" style="max-width: 95%; display:block; margin: auto; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #888; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;" /></p>

<p><strong>Phone validation is broken</strong> - apparently DZone doesn't like the
fact that I've got a nice / memorable number with repeating digits
(that's not my number btw, but I just changed the digits for this
article, the format is the same). The phone is required too, . Why the
heck do you need my phone number anyway? Isn't email enough? I always
check my email, I'm always connected. And it should be up to me to
decide what contacting options you receive. I complained to them about
this. 24 hours later, no response.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases in which people want to show their
cleverness. <em>Oh, look at my form, it's so clever</em>. Just like the
people that think a maximum <em>password length</em> of 16 to 30 chars is a
good idea (DZone does this too btw) - in the spirit of always
validating your inputs. After all, those plain-text passwords in their
database eats up space.</p>

<p><strong>Zip/Postal Code is required</strong>. I don't know it by default, I never
use it anyway, never. For DZone I didn't even bother to look it up. I
never bothered to provide a correct one for Amazon, which is actually
sending me stuff, like purchased items or money. So I provided a fake
one.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Company Name required?</strong> - Maybe I'm an independent. Maybe
I'm unemployed. Maybe I don't want to freaking tell you about it. Are
you going to harass me through my employer in case I don't behave? I
won't even mention the required-ness of the job title / job
function. Would that prove I'm qualified? That's just sad.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to simulate Facebook's original exclusiveness. However
make sure people actually want to be members first.</p>

<p><strong>I don't know the size of the company I'm working for</strong> - maybe this
is a no brainer for the people that actually care to put this on their
business cards or talk about it at <em>stand-ups</em> within the company,
just before gathering around a fire singing Kumbaya. However, the
company I work for has people distributed in remote locations and I
don't interact with all of them, while big corporations have centers
all over the world - to not lie, you'd basically have to do a google
search, or ask around, just to get past a freaking form (that doesn't
send you money for the effort).</p>

<p>So there you have it, a good example.</p>
