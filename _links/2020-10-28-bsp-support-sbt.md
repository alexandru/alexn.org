_"Today we are proud to announce that support of BSP has been shipped into sbt 1.4.0 ... BSP in sbt improves the integration of sbt inside IDEs and code editors."_

_"BSP is inspired by LSP, the Language Server Protocol. The main difference being that LSP abstracts over the language whereas BSP abstracts over the build tool."_
