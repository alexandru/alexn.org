_"Cats Effect 3.0.0-M1 is the very first milestone release in the 3.0.0 line. We are expecting to follow this milestone with subsequent ones as necessary to further refine functionality and features, prior to some number of release candidates leading to a final release. The designation "M1" is meant to indicate our relative confidence in the functionality and API of the library, but it by no means indicates completeness or final compatibility. Neither binary compatibility nor source compatibility with anything are assured prior to 3.0.0, though major breakage is unlikely at this point."_
