The talk will explain why category theory is of interest for developers. The principle of Propositions as Types describes a correspondence between propositions and proofs in logic, on the one hand, and types and programs in computing, on the other. Category theory constitutes a third leg of this correspondence. Assuming only enough familiarity with functional programming that you know why ‘Lambda World’ has that name, the talk will explain how to model products (logical and), sums (logical or), and functions (logical implication), and why you already learned the most important stuff in high school.
